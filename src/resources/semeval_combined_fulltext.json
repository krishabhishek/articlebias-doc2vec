The market expected a small increase in pricing after Glencore's recent downgrade.\nThe financing is led by active bookrunners ABN AMRO, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, HSBC, ING and Santander.\nGlencore said in December it had increased its current liquidity to more than $14 billion, meaning that the company does not require a facility of the same size as last year.\nShares in Glencore were trading up 10.3 percent at 113.50 pence at 1039 GMT on the London Stock Exchange, putting them at the top of the blue-chip FTSE 100 index. The shares are up more than 25 percent so far this year after falling around  70 percent in 2015.\n(Editing by Christopher Mangham and Susan Thomas)\nNext In Hot Stocks\n",

  "articleText" : "Barclays share price subdued as bank faces fresh forex probe\nSouth Korea to assess impact of currency rigging\nby Jane Tindall Wednesday, 17 Jun 2015, 14:46 BST\nBarclays (LON:BRC) and five other international banks â€“ Citigroup, JPMorgan, Royal Bank of Scotland Group (LON:RBS) and UBS -- are facing a fresh inquiry into their alleged role in rigging of foreign exchange markets. South Koreaâ€™s Fair Trade Commission (FTC) is investigating whether local firms were impacted by the global lenders, the Seoul Economic Daily first reported yesterday. Jeong Jae-chun, the chairman of the competition watchdog, confirmed the probe during a parliamentary hearing today, without naming the banks specifically or disclosing further details.\nThe FTC would be the latest regulator to join global peers in probing the impact of currency rigging -- probes that have resulted in billions of dollars in settlements from banks forced to improve their oversight of foreign-exchange trading systems and personnel. The six lenders have already agreed to pay fines of more than $5.6 billion in Europe and the US.\nAccording to lawyers, it may take the FTC years to prove the damaging effects on local companies in South Korea, although the banksâ€™ rigging of euro-dollar rates was likely to have affected local market rates such as won-dollar or won-euro. \"It's a complicated case. Depending on how well the connections can be made, the FTC could drop it early or it could take a while,\" an unnamed lawyer said, as quoted by Reuters today.\nSeparate to the regulatory investigation, Barclays and its peers may also face a court battle in South Korea. According to media reports, several local companies plan to file a collective lawsuit against the  banks seeking damages from their forex trades.\nBarclays share price has been subdued so far today. As of 14:21 BST, the stock was trading 0.42 percent down at 262.55p.\n",

  "articleText" : "JIM ARMITAGE\nWednesday 16 September 2015 14:21 BST\nNo sympathy: Glasenberg’s dividend take from Glencore has been nearly three-quarters of a billion dollars over four years Yim Yik/EPA\nIn case you were feeling sorry for the kings of Glencore for having to shell out all those hundreds of millions of pounds to bail out their business, here’s a thought. \nDespite the fact Ivan Glasenberg has had to chip in £137.6 million, Daniel Mate £42.2 million and Telis Mistakidis £51.8 million, it still only represents a quarter of what they’ve taken out of the company in dividends since flotation in 2011.\nThough the paper money they made stuffing our pension funds with shares in their absurdly over-valued business has now collapsed by four-fifths, they’ve still been coining it in real, hard cash.\nGlasenberg’s dividend take alone has been nearly three-quarters of a billion dollars over the four years.\nMeanwhile his shares — for which he has paid little cash until now, remember — are still worth £1.4 billion. And that’s before you look at management’s everyday pay and bonuses.\nGlasenberg and his crew are traders first and foremost — they’ve been evaluating risk and placing bets every day of their professional lives. Ordinarily, given their legendary smarts, you’d think the clever move would be to follow their example and buy into the stock — fund managers obviously did last night.\nBut, as with most trades these guys make in their day-to-day lives, this deal has more angles than it first seems.\nFor a start, Glencore management were forced into doing it against their will — how else do you explain the sudden turnaround from Glasenberg’s message to the market three weeks earlier that no such recapitalisation was necessary?\nGlencore: The humbling of boss Ivan Glasenberg\nAnd if they weren’t keen to do it, perhaps it’s not the smart trade for external investors after all.\nWithout the fundraising, Glencore’s credit rating was under threat, potentially hampering its traders’ positions. Other factors were also doubtless in management minds, which we’ll never know.\nAnd that has always been the problem with Glencore: nobody on the outside could ever really expect to understand how a secretive bunch of Swiss-based traders in an industry renowned for sailing close to the wind really thinks and operates. \nWhich prompts the question: why did our fund managers ever believe it was a suitable place to put our pensions in the first place?\n123 at £5 = £100 million\nRetail banking chiefs are only talking about one thing this week: Santander’s decision to whack up the fees on its hugely popular 123 account, raising its monthly fee for customers from £2 to £5 a month.\nBack-of-an-envelope calculations suggest the fee hike will bring in a cool £100 million a year.\nNice to have at a time of continued low interest rates and ever-increasing bank overheads.\nMore about:\n",

  "articleText" : "Barclays to accelerate its focus on `core strengths'\nTurmoil in markets threatens revenue, carries into 2016\nShare on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp\nA revenue slump is adding urgency to cost cutting at Barclays Plc and Deutsche Bank AG, where new chief executive officers are racing to raise profitability.\nBarclays said Thursday it’s accelerating a plan to focus on “core strengths and running the business for returns,” while shutting offices in nine countries. Deutsche Bank, based in Frankfurt, said Wednesday that revenue dropped about 16 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, driven by its securities unit, Europe’s largest.\nThe volatility that affected trading at the end of last year carried into 2016 as doubts about growth in China persisted and the selloff in crude oil deepened. Europe’s biggest investment banks, which saw profitability shrink as regulators tightened capital standards, now face increased pressure on revenue.\n“The environment worsened in the fourth quarter from the third and investors are asking themselves whether that’s the start of a trend,” said Michael Huenseler, who helps manage 17.4 billion euros ($18.8 billion) at Assenagon Asset Management in Munich. “If that’s the case, it would suggest that those banks who are taking the most radical action on cutting back their trading businesses are on the right track.”\nWhile Barclays said revenue at its investment bank, led by Tom King, was “broadly flat” in 2015 from the previous year, that implies that the unit’s income in the fourth quarter fell 11 percent. Deutsche Bank cited “challenging market conditions” for its fourth-quarter slump.\nThe comments suggest European securities firms are set to report a deeper decline in revenue than their competitors in the U.S. The five biggest U.S. firms saw their combined revenue from investment banking and trading fall 4.9 percent to $24.2 billion in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\nDeutsche Bank may have had a “decent” performance in foreign exchange and rates trading in the fourth quarter that still couldn’t make up for “challenging” revenues in credit, high-yield debt, leveraged lending and emerging markets trading, UBS Group AG analyst Daniele Brupbacher wrote in a note to clients.\nSlumping Shares\nBank shares have been hit by concern that China’s economy is slowing and that the fallout from a drop in commodity prices will erode corporate profits. The 46-company Stoxx Europe 600 Banks Index has fallen 14 percent this year. Deutsche Bank dropped 23 percent while Barclays declined 14 percent.\nEuropean bank shares are being undermined by concern over the industry’s profit sustainability, John Cryan, Deutsche Bank’s co-CEO, told reporters at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Wednesday. Markets may see current levels of volatility for years to come unless “we see active investment picking up,” he said.\n“The history of banks is to be too thinly capitalized, to be too leveraged in a very volatile business and that’s not a great recipe,” Credit Suisse Group AG CEO Tidjane Thiam said in a Bloomberg TV interview in Davos on Friday. “All the banks, and we at Credit Suisse, are working very hard to change that business model so that we bring it back to less volatility. But we’re not there yet, that’s a two, three-year journey.”\nCredit Suisse laid out plans in October to cut as many as 5,600 jobs and focus more on wealth management, while shrinking and splitting up the investment bank.\nDeutsche Bank is eliminating about 9,000 jobs on a net basis by 2018. While the company hasn’t broken out the number of positions that will go at its securities unit, the businesses it plans to shrink or close are mainly in its capital-intensive fixed-income trading arm.\nAsia Pullback\nBarclays CEO Jes Staley started a fresh round of cuts at the investment bank that will eliminate 1,200 jobs worldwide and shut securities operations across Asia, people with knowledge of the matter said this week. The biggest cuts at the London-based bank will fall in the Asia-Pacific region, and include winding up the cash equities business, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the decision isn’t public.\nCredit Suisse views the retreat of its competitors in some emerging markets as an opportunity to expand, according to Thiam. “When others are retrenching, suddenly teams who would never have talked to us, talk to us because others are leaving the region,” he said.\nU.S. banks are also trimming. Morgan Stanley eliminated about 1,200 employees last quarter, including about a quarter of the fixed-income trading staff, a person briefed on the matter said. Bank of America Corp., which cut more than 10,000 jobs last year, will reduce staffing in 2016 to trim costs amid declining revenue, CEO Brian Moynihan said in a Bloomberg TV interview in Davos.\n“Universal banks are nearly all coming to the same conclusion,” said Sandy Chen, an analyst at Cenkos Securities Plc in London. “When you’re allocating assets, investment banking is the lowest return business in terms of return on capital.”\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

  "articleText" : "Diageo sales disappoint as currency and comparatives leave bitter taste\nThu, 16 April 2015\nFTSE 100 Quote\nPrice: 6,840.75 Chg: 11.55 Chg %: 0.17% Date: 17:14\nOrganic sales from Diageo fell 0.7% in the third quarter, a much worse result than the increase analysts had expected, as the drinks group blamed currency headwinds in Latin America and tough comparatives in the UK.\nIn the three months to end March, organic net sales fell 0.7%, way off the 2% City consensus forecast, dragging net sales for the last nine month down 0.3%.\nVolume was down 0.8% in the quarter, resulting in a 1.7% decline in the nine month period.\nIn the nine month period reported total net sales growth of 4.6% as a £700m contribution from the July acquisition of United Spirits more than counterbalance a £298m adverse currency impact and a £28m hole from disposals.\nBroker Shore Capital said the quarterly result does not change the broader picture of the market's expectation of a broadly flat top line performance for the year but that the new forex guidance, notably including a material move for the Venezuelan bolivar, is going to see a further small implied downgrade to forecasts.\nChief executive Ivan Menezes admitted lower inflation and weak economies \"will lead to subdued net sales growth\" in the current year despite the operational improvements management was pushing.\n\"Our performance in the quarter reflects continued tough conditions in the emerging markets and subdued consumer demand in some developed markets,\" said Menezes.\n\"However it also reflects the actions we have taken to ensure we are building a stronger business.\"\nThe currency issues contributed to a 10.2% decline in LAC in the quarter and 3.3% for the fiscal year to date, while Asia Pacific was down 6% in the quarter partly as a result of the self imposed de-stock in South Asia to reduce inventory levels.\nMenezes noted that consumers in North America remained resilient but that lower gas prices and a more favourable macro outlook have only seen slight growth in the spirits category and he does not expect to see shipments improve \"until we have lapped last year\".\nNorth American sales were up 0.9% in the quarter, dragging the nine-monthly figure up to 0.2%.\nWhile among the other regions, Africa was the highlight with double digit growth in Africa Regional Markets and East Africa, with Europe disappointed with a 1.3% decline in the quarter and the nine-month figure for the region down to a 0.5% fall.\n\"Overall, the positives are the gradual improvement in Africa and talk of improving trends in the US - albeit they have not really been seen as yet,\" said ShoreCap's Phil Carroll.\nHe believes the group remains in a period of transition \"but it would appear the business still remains some way off from delivering the positive momentum required to generate upgrades potential\" and therefore retain his 'hold' recommendation.\nContrasting fortunes as mainstream drinks under pressure\nDiageo, which saw its shares down around 2% by mid-morning on Thursday in contrast to drinks rival SABMiller's 2% gain as it also released quarterly results.\nSome industry analysts see both company's mainstream offering as being threatened by the trend towards craft products.\nThe mainly mainstream brands produced by Diageo and SAB are under threat from a trend towards more niche drinks, such as craft beers, according to Johnny Forsyth, global drinks analyst at market research firm Mintel.\n\"Consumers are avoiding what they see as generic style beers in favour of craft products, things with a story seen as smaller and more niche. That's a real real problem for SAB Miller who produce mainstream beers and that's also a problem for Diageo who have got a lot of mainstream brands. They're almost stuck in this middle area where they're not quite cheap enough or value enough for every day occasion but not quite premium enough for special occasions.\"\nHe praised SAB's move away from alcohol into soft drinks as developed countries see a decline in alcohol consumption.\n\"SAB Miller have really changed, they're a lot more into soft drinks than they were before,\" he said in an interview on CNBC.\n\"Especially in the developed world we're seeing a decline in alcohol consumption. It actually makes a lot of sense as a business to realign and not be so so dependent on alcoholic drinks.\"\n",

  "articleText" : "4 June 2015\n \nVoluntary actions initiated to remove smaller size components and change Instructions for Use (IFU) following analysis of recent performance data\nNo action required from patients; no change to current practice for patient follow-up care\nBHR continues to perform amongst the best hip replacements for the right patients\n \nSmith & Nephew (LSE: SN; NYSE: SNN), the global medical technology business, announces the voluntary removal from the market of 46mm diameter and smaller femoral heads and corresponding acetabular cup components for the BIRMINGHAM HIP◊ Resurfacing (BHR) System , and new Instructions for Use (IFU), reflecting recent performance data. Surgeons should maintain their routine follow-up protocol for patients, and patients are not required to take any new action. \nAndy Weymann MD, Smith & Nephew’s Chief Medical Officer, said: “Patient welfare is Smith & Nephew’s top priority. Based on our analysis of our most recent data, we are taking the necessary steps to ensure that the BHR is only used in those patient groups where it has demonstrated strong performance. These represent the vast majority of current patients.”\nAs part of its normal post-market surveillance, Smith & Nephew has conducted an analysis of recent National Joint Registry of England and Wales (NJREW) data. This indicated that the BHR continues to deliver performance in line with the best total hip replacements in male patients under 65 requiring femoral head components 50mm in diameter and larger. However, the revision rates associated with men requiring femoral head sizes 46mm or smaller and with all women patients exceed the current benchmark established by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Based on this information, Smith & Nephew considers that these patient groups may be at a greater risk of revision surgery than previously believed, and is therefore removing small sizes and updating the IFU to contraindicate the BHR for women.\nSmith & Nephew is not advising proactive revisions for existing patients unless required for clinical reasons. As with all medical devices, anyone experiencing unusual symptoms should contact their surgeon. BHR patients can also visit the website www.smith-nephew.com/BHR .   \nThe removed products accounted for around 1% of Smith & Nephew’s global hip implant revenue in 2014, and 0.1% of Group revenues. This action will have no impact on guidance for the Full Year.\n \nNotes to editors:\nDefinition of Resurfacing\nIn a traditional total hip replacement the femoral head and acetabular socket are both removed and replaced.  The femoral implant is a stemmed device that is placed down the shaft of the femur and accepts a head which articulates against the acetabular implant.  In hip resurfacing the femoral head is not removed but is instead trimmed and capped (resurfaced) with a smooth metal covering. The damaged bone and cartilage within the acetabular socket is removed and replaced with a monolithic metal shell which articulates against the resurfaced head.\nOn a procedure volume basis, the global resurfacing market represents <0.5% of the total hip arthroplasty market. \n \n",

  "articleText" : "Tesco torn apart as watchdog finds supermarket repeatedly withheld payments from suppliers\nBut chief executive claims grocer’s worst excesses are now in the past\nWednesday 27 January 2016 01:09 BST\nClick to follow\nThe Independent Online\nThe Groceries Code Adjudicator found that Tesco encouraged suppliers to give it extra cash in return for more control over where products appeared on shelves Bloomberg\nTesco deliberately and repeatedly withheld money owed to suppliers to boost its sales performance artificially, in a serious breach of supermarket regulations, the sector’s watchdog has found.\nThe Groceries Code Adjudicator also said that the supermarket would encourage suppliers to give it extra cash in return for more control over where products appeared on shelves or to avoid losing out to rivals. In the weeks leading up to Tesco’s results presentations to the City and investors, buyers were also encouraged to push suppliers even harder to accept payment delays in order to flatter the sales figures, according to the findings.\nThe matter of misreporting to the stock market is now being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO).\nTesco payments scandal: A verbal waterboarding was only the start\nChristine Tacon, the head of the GCA, demanded that Tesco improve relations with suppliers, stop taking money from them without permission and speed up correction of the many errors that would occur on its payment systems. She also said that all finance and buying teams must be trained in the findings of the investigation.\nHer report came as the Tesco chief executive, Dave Lewis, issued another public apology to suppliers about the issues raised and insisted that new safeguards were in place to avoid future problems.\nHowever, the report was also the trigger for lawyers for a group of investors to write to the company. It was the first step towards a lawsuit for lost earnings as a result of the share price crash when it was revealed that profits had been inflated.\nThe 60-page document is the first significant report into Tesco’s internal workings since it admitted that it had overstated profits under the leadership of its former chief executive, Phil Clarke. It paints a picture of a culture where staff were encouraged to boost margins at any cost and ignore pleas for payment. In one case Ms Tacon found that Tesco had withheld a multimillion-pound payment to one supplier for more than two years. Several suppliers also made payments of £1m to Tesco, regardless of whether more of their products had been sold.\nMs Tacon said: “A Tesco list of methods for meeting the half-year target included ‘not paying back money owed’. The evidence I received revealed a number of examples of Tesco deliberately deferring payment of money in order to maintain its margin at key financial reporting periods.\n“I find that Tesco knowingly delayed paying money to suppliers in order to improve its own financial position.”\nShe added: “In particular, requests for payments to meet margin targets appeared to be more prevalent at the end of trading periods. Some suppliers reported that what set Tesco apart from other retailers was the pressure it put on suppliers at the end of a financial quarter, half-year or full year. \n“It is very clear that delay in payments was a widespread issue that affected a broad range of Tesco suppliers on a significant scale.”\nMs Tacon also pointed to the “reluctance of some Tesco buyers to proactively engage in the resolution of payment disputes. There were times when Tesco did not appear to even attempt to resolve supplier concerns before unilaterally deducting money from suppliers.”\nIn some cases, suppliers in dispute were forced to call Tesco’s service centre in Hindustan, even though staff there were not authorised to make payments. She added: “The most shocking thing I found was how widespread it was…. Every supplier I spoke to had evidence of delays in payment.”\nBosses were in breach of the groceries code on payment delays, but not on charging suppliers directly for prominent positioning on shelves, she said. \nHowever, the adjudicator did find examples of indirect charging, with suppliers paying hundreds of thousands of pounds to become part of the supermarket’s range review, or “category captaincy”, which allowed them to be the dominant product in a category. Tesco claimed these policies had since been eradicated, and Ms Tacon said she would look more closely at the wording of the code to see whether it needed changing in light of the indirect links between suppliers making payments and getting prominent shelf positions or the ear of buyers.\nThe report led to the third-party litigation finance group Bentham Europe, which represents between 50 and 100 institutional investors in Tesco, revealing that it had appointed the law firm Stewarts Law to write to the supermarket to start formal legal action.\nSean Upson, the Stewarts Law partner in charge of the Tesco claim, said: “There is mounting public evidence that Tesco’s management were aware that the financial statements were untrue or misleading, and claims against Tesco have a solid basis.”\nExperts said the amount owed could run into hundreds of millions of pounds. Last year, Tesco settled a case in the US with investors for $12m(£8m). \nDavid Scott of Scott & Scott, the law firm representing Tesco Shareholder Claims Ltd, which is filing a separate suit, said it would wait for the SFO report before pressing ahead with its claim.\nMr Lewis said no money has been set aside by Tesco to cover any legal costs. He has since introduced simpler contracts with suppliers and accepted the report in full, saying the worst of Tesco’s excesses were now a thing of the past.\nMore about:\n",

  "articleText" : "Here’s my 10-point plan to make Tesco great again\nThe supermarket announced a record annual loss of £6.38bn this week\nFriday 24 April 2015 08:48 BST\nClick to follow\nThe Independent Online\nTesco is looking for ways to plug its estimated £5bn black hole Getty Images\nPut yourself in Dave Lewis’s shoes, said the Editor. You’re Lewis, the new boss of Tesco. You knew the store group had lost its way when you joined from Unilever (or else you would not have been recruited in the first place).\nBut what you found was a horror show . Almost the first thing that was brought to your attention was the alleged overstating of the accounts. You launched an investigation, and threw the book at those responsible. That’s now the subject of a Serious Fraud Office inquiry.\nIn truth, the claimed jiggery-pokery was minor in relation to Tesco’s overall numbers. But it was symptomatic of an underlying malaise, one that has led to a record annual loss announced this week of £6.38bn.\nRead more\nThe five reasons behind Tesco's historic £6.4 billion loss\nStaff are demoralised, suppliers (some of whom, it transpires, were treated appallingly) won’t go that extra mile for the firm, and customers are deserting in droves. You know the head office is overstaffed and you’ve taken an axe to that. Likewise, you’ve quickly identified some stores that are underperforming, and they’re going too.\nMeanwhile, as you’re never allowed to forget, Aldi and Lidl are chipping away at your customer base, and Morrisons, Sainsbury and Asda are also loving every minute of your pain. So, put all that on one side. What would you do? Here it is, my 10-point plan to save Tesco.\n1. Put the customer first. It’s easier said than done, when you’ve got City analysts coming at you with yet more charts calculating this yield, and that ratio. What it means is always, always think of the shopper. Get out among them. How do they find the stores? What sort of treatment do they receive? Are we giving them what they want? Are they satisfied? If not, why not?\n2. Be first. Time was when Tesco had the reputation for being the great supermarket innovator, for being first with everything. It was the first to launch the Clubcard loyalty scheme, first to open all the checkouts so there was never more than one person in front of you in the queue.\nTesco needs to recover its name for being the differentiator. Make it famous again. Set new standards of service, so there is someone helping choose a trolley, someone greeting you at the door, someone in each section of the store taking pride in their shelves, assisting and guiding.\nMake sure there is someone, if needed, to help unload and pack. Likewise, in the car park, ensure someone is roaming round, offering to put the bags away and take the trolley back.\n3. Make the stores friendly. They’re too east European, too utilitarian. Widen the aisles. Put in free treats, not just as an enticement to buy but a genuine extra. Make the deli counter spectacular, staffed by gregarious, knowledgeable people. Set up displays of cooking, to break the monotony and provide dynamism. Bring local produce to the fore. Restore the frills. Nothing is too trivial. Remember, “Every little helps”.\n4. Cut prices but don’t go mad. Folk are heading to the discounters and Tesco should move in that direction, to narrow the gap. But don’t lose sight of providing add-ons – people will be prepared to pay a bit more than at Aldi or Lidl if they get something for it. That could be anything from familiar, kind faces to extra points on the loyalty card.\nTesco’s former great, Sir Terry Leahy, used to refer to it as a “broad church”.  It’s not just a case of offering low prices per se.\n5. Make Tesco.com as good as Ocado. The brightest spot in your universe is Tesco.com, which continues to grow and outperform the market. But while Tesco.com outstrips Ocado, the online deliverer lags behind its rival for quality of service. Change that – make it so the middle classes wax lyrical about Tesco’s care, not Ocado’s.\n6. Stand back from the organisation and ask yourself, have I got enough women? By that I mean women in the right places. Promote them, move them, so that stores are managed by women (one of the abiding mysteries of food retailing is why so many senior personnel are men), product ranges are chosen by women, layouts designed by women.\n7. Change the senior male culture. It goes hand in hand with point No 6 but it was always noticeable just how aggressive, and with that, male, the previous Tesco top management had become. Customers did not bother about boasts about logistical efficiencies or supply chain management, they wanted value for their money and to feel valued as they spent it. Pick real women, not managerial imitations of men. Ask yourself: would women sanction the purchase of even one corporate jet?\n8. Find a face that says Tesco. Awkward one this, but others  have done it – Waitrose with Heston and Delia, Sainsbury with Jamie. It doesn’t have to be a cook – we all eat and buy food – but  should be someone who stands  for Tesco values.\nBack in 1990 it was Dudley Moore – his series of funny, quirky adverts for Tesco, beginning with French free-range chickens, changed supermarket advertising.  You need a new, warm Dudley figure that gets the whole country talking. David Beckham? Peter Kay?\n9. Love your suppliers. If I could cite the moment when Tesco turned sour it was when reports circulated of suppliers being dragged to your headquarters, and being pressurised into agreeing new terms.\nThey’re your friends, your partners. Get the best out of them and you will be the best.\n10. Have fun. Tesco has become a faceless, drab behemoth, lacking character and individuality. Encourage your staff to smile, to have a laugh, make them put on daft events, hold in-store competitions to raise money for local good causes – make shoppers want to go there, instead of regarding a trip to Tesco as a form of torture.\nGood luck.\n",

  "articleText" : "0\nNEW ORLEANS (AP) — Attorneys for BP told a federal appeals court Thursday that the company should be able to get back some of the money it paid in economic damage claims to businesses and individuals under a settlement arising from the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill.\nAfter the 2012 settlement was approved, BP argued that the claims administrator had not been correctly matching business' revenues and expenses, resulting in overpayments. A court eventually ordered a new calculation method but refused to order restitution of payments already made.\nThe company wants restitution of some of the money paid out prior to October 2013. Attorneys told the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that restitution could involve more than 790 businesses, with hundreds of millions of dollars at stake.\n\"A wrong was done,\" BP attorney Thomas Hungar told a three-judge 5th Circuit panel, arguing that the settlement does not preclude BP from seeking repayment of inflated claims.\nAttorneys representing a variety of plaintiffs in the case opposed the move. Samuel Issacharoff told the court that those who signed releases and received settlement payments had a right to expect that \"this was their money. They were able to get on with their lives.\"\nFifth Circuit chief Judge Carl Stewart heard the arguments with judges Edward Prado and Gregg Costa. A ruling isn't expected immediately.\nThe case is among the lingering legal issues after major settlements in the massive oil spill that resulted from the April 2010 explosion of the Deepwater Horizon offshore rig, which killed 11 people. Earlier this year, BP reached an $18.7 billion agreement with governments in the five Gulf Coast states affected by the spill.\nThe 2012 settlement with businesses and individuals claiming losses from the spill is expected to cost BP over $10 billion. As of July 31, the claims administrator had paid out $5.61 billion, according to a report filed in federal court this week.\nOther costs incurred by the company after the spill include an estimated $14 billion for response and cleanup and $4.5 billion in penalties announced after a settlement of a criminal case with the federal government.\n",

  "articleURL" : "http://in.reuters.com/article/bp-results-idINKCN0VB0OD",
  "articleText" : "Global Energy News | Tue Feb 2, 2016 | 10:44pm IST\nBP reports biggest ever annual loss\nBy Karolin Schaps and Ron Bousso | LONDON\nLONDON BP slumped to its biggest annual loss last year and announced thousands more job cuts on Tuesday, showing that even one of the nimblest oil producers is struggling in the worst market downturn in over a decade.\nThe British oil and gas company, which is still grappling with about $55 billion of costs from the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, said it would cut 7,000 jobs by the end of 2017, or nearly 9 percent of its workforce.\nBP said it lost $6.5 billion in 2015 and its fourth-quarter underlying replacement cost profit, which is the company's definition of net income, came in at $196 million, well below analyst expectations of $730 million.\nBP shares fell as much as 8.5 percent and were 8.1 percent lower at 1136 GMT, the worst performer on the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index and on track for their biggest one-day fall since June 2010.\nThe company's 2015 loss shows that even its \"shrink to grow\" strategy adopted after the Macondo rig explosion in 2010, hailed as the best preparation for a weak oil market, was unable to buffer the impact of the lowest oil prices since 2003.\n\"Should low oil prices prevail, they're a quarter or two away from having to cut the dividend, or divest some more assets,\" said Jack Allardyce, analyst at Cenkos Securities.\nDividends are considered sacrosanct among most major oil companies but BP's weak results and outlook are likely to put pressure on a company that has had to increase borrowing. BP maintained its 2015 dividend at 10 cents per share.\nBP's results are the latest to show the extent large oil companies are struggling following a 70 percent slide in oil prices since the middle of 2014 that has forced them to cut tens of thousands of jobs and slash spending.\nBP's 2015 annual loss was bigger than the overall loss of $4.9 billion it reported in 2010, even though it took a $17.2 billion hit in the second quarter of that year after the explosion in the Gulf of Mexico.\nBP declined to comment when asked if the company's 2015 loss was the biggest on record.\nChevron, the second biggest U.S. producer behind Exxon Mobil, reported its first quarterly loss last week in more than 13 years. Royal Dutch Shell is expected to report a near halving of profits.\nBP's poor results came a day after credit ratings agency Standard and Poor's placed the company on the path towards a credit downgrade and lowered Shell's rating.\nBP took a bigger-than-expected hit at its upstream oil and gas production business and booked charges of $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter because of low oil prices, including on fields in the Gulf of Mexico, the U.S. Utica shale acreage in Ohio and Libya.\nAnalysts at Bernstein said warmer than expected weather in 2015 probably meant that BP took a hit from some of its oil and gas hedging positions.\nBenchmark Brent oil prices averaged $43 a barrel in the fourth quarter of 2015, down from $76 a year earlier. The poor market backdrop is set to persist with Brent averaging about $33 per barrel in 2016 so far.\nCOST CUTS\nBP said if the current downturn persists for longer than anticipated, it would be able to reduce its costs further to allow its balance sheet to break even below $60 a barrel.\n\"Should current conditions persist for longer than anticipated, we expect that all the actions we are taking will capture more deflation,\" Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary said in a statement.\nThe oil and gas sector is set to slash spending to its lowest in six years in 2016 to $522 billion, following a 22 percent fall to $595 billion in 2015, according to analysts.\nIt would be the first time since 1986 that the industry has cut spending for two consecutive years.\nBP said its capital spending came to $18.7 billion in 2015, down from a planned $24-$26 billion, and it expected 2016 spending to be at the lower end of a $17-19 billion range.\nBP reduced operating costs by $3.5 billion last year and said it expected savings to reach $7 billion by 2017.\nIt plans to cut 3,000 jobs in its downstream division by the end of 2017, on top of 4,000 cuts in its oil and gas production business announced last year.\n\"We are continuing to move rapidly to adapt and rebalance BP for the changing environment,\" Chief Executive Bob Dudley said in a statement.\nDespite lower revenue from oil production, BP's output rose 5.4 percent to 2.26 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.\nIts refining and trading operations, benefiting from cheap fuel prices, once again offset losses in oil and gas production, although BP indicated that supply and trading weakened over the fourth quarter compared to a year earlier.\nLike many of its peers, BP has tapped the debt market to plug the gap in income to cover spending and dividend payouts. BP said it intends to maintain its debt at current levels. Its debt-to-equity ratio stood at 21.6 percent at the end of 2015.\n(Editing by Jason Neely and David Clarke)\nA BP logo is seen outside a petrol station in London February 4, 2008.

REUTERS/Phil Noble\nBy Ben Hirschler | LONDON\nLONDON Novo Nordisk and AstraZeneca, two drugmakers whose financial outlooks disappointed investors last month, are both hoping for a boost in the coming weeks from results of two closely watched clinical trials.\nAstraZeneca wants to prove its blood-thinner Brilinta can help stroke patients, in addition to those with heart problems, while Novo aims to showcase the cardiovascular benefits of its blockbuster diabetes treatment Victoza.\nWhile positive outcomes are not guaranteed, industry analysts believe AstraZeneca may have the easier task.\nIts so-called SOCRATES trial is assessing whether Brilinta can do better than aspirin, the current standard of care, in preventing recurrent attacks in the 90 days after patients suffer a stroke.\nHistory suggests it has a good chance, since Sanofi's now off-patent drug Plavix previously showed limited benefit in stroke and Brilinta is more potent. The main risk is that Brilinta might cause more dangerous bleeding.\nA positive result would boost consensus forecasts for Brilinta, which currently stand at an annual $1.8 billion for 2020, according to Thomson Reuters Cortellis.\nThat is well short of AstraZeneca's own projection of $3.5 billion by 2023, but Deutsche Bank analysts believe the addressable market for Brilinta could double if SOCRATES and another study in peripheral artery disease (PAD), due in the second half of 2016, both hit their goals.\n“We started with the heart but this could be the year when we go beyond the coronary setting by addressing the head and strokes, and also open another chapter with the limbs through addressing the possible treatment of PAD,” said Ludovic Helfgott, head of AstraZeneca's Brilinta business.\nAstraZeneca has so far only promised stroke results sometime in the first half of 2016. However, its study was due to complete last month, according to clinicaltrials.gov, suggesting initial headline findings may emerge relatively soon.\nResults from Novo's cardiovascular trial known as LEADER, the Danish firm's largest clinical study to date, are due before the end of March.\nNovo is under pressure to prove its drug can cut the danger of heart attacks and strokes, after the unprecedented success of Eli Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim's Jardiance pill in slashing deaths in diabetics with heart risk.\nChief Science Officer Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen said in an interview in November that Victoza, which sold $2.6 billion in 2015, almost certainly does have heart benefits. But he's not 100 percent sure if these will be apparent in the relatively sick patients enrolled in LEADER.\n(Editing by Susan Thomas)\n",

REUTERS/U.S. Coast Guard/Files/Handout\nBy Jonathan Stempel\nA U.S. federal appeals court said on Friday BP Plc (BP.L) deserves the right to appellate review of some damage claims awarded to people and businesses in connection with the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill.\nThe decision by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans could help BP limit its payout to victims of the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig, which killed 11 workers and caused the largest U.S. offshore oil spill.\nBP originally expected to pay $7.8 billion to resolve claims under a 2012 settlement, but by late April it had boosted its estimate to $10.3 billion, according to a regulatory filing.\nAbout $5.13 billion has been paid out so far to 63,597 claimants, according to a website maintained by claims administrator Patrick Juneau.\nIn its appeal, BP complained that rules adopted by U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier compromised its right to appeal awards he approved and which the company did not like to the 5th Circuit.\nWriting for the appeals court, Judge Fortunato Benavides said BP deserved that right to appeal because it did not expressly waive it.\n\"Where a settlement agreement does not resolve claims itself but instead establishes a mechanism pursuant to which the district court will resolve claims, parties must expressly waive what is otherwise a right to appeal from claim determination decisions by a district court,\" the judge wrote.\n\"The point at which a party seeks the district court's discretionary review is the point at which further review by this court becomes a possibility.\"\nThe 5th Circuit separately rejected BP's appeal of awards to three non-profit groups. Lawyers for spill victims accused BP of appealing the awards as a means to relitigate the entire settlement.\nSamuel Issacharoff, a lawyer for the victims, declined immediate comment.\nBP spokesman Geoff Morrell said the company is pleased with the ruling on appeals of individual claims determinations.\nBP is awaiting a decision from Barbier assessing penalties under the federal Clean Water Act over the spill.\nLondon-based BP has already taken $43.8 billion in pre-tax charges for clean-up and other costs.\nThe cases are In re: Deepwater Horizon, 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Nos. 13-30843, 13-31296, 13-31299, 13-31302.\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York.

  "articleText" : "BERENBERG RESUMES BOOKER GROUP WITH 'BUY' - TARGET 189 PENCE\n---------\nLiberum Cuts Shell Price Target To 2,120p From 2,230p, Reiterates Hold\n----------\nCOMPANIES - FTSE 100\n----------\nSky posted a big increase in pretax profit for its first half, boosted by a rise in revenue and exceptional gains from its sale of its stakes in ITV and the National Geographic Channel, in its first results that incorporate its acquisitions of Sky Italia and a majority stake in Sky Deutschland. Sky posted a pretax profit of GBP1.21 billion for the half year to end-December, compared to GBP507 million a year before, on revenue of GBP4.30 billion compared to GBP3.67 billion. Profit was boosted by a GBP492 million gain from the sale of its 6.4% stake in ITV PLC and a GBP296 million gain from the sale of its stake in the National Geographic Channel. Sky proposed an interim dividend of 12.30 pence, up from 12.00 pence a year before.\n----------\nVodafone Group is set to make its first move into the \"multiplay\" market of bundled telecoms and internet services in the next few weeks, the Financial Times reported. Vodafone will unveil plans in the next couple of weeks for a push into the UK consumer broadband market in a bid to counter the shift by rivals BT Group and Sky to add mobile to their fixed line services.\n----------\nHargreaves Lansdown reported a drop in first-half pretax profit despite a rise in assets under administration over the course of the six months, in what it described as a \"muted\" time for stocks and retail investors. In a statement, the investment management product provider said pretax profit declined to GBP101.9 million in the six months ended December 31 from GBP104.1 million in the corresponding period last year. Assets under administration rose to GBP49.1 billion at the end of 2014, from GBP46.9 billion six months earlier and GBP43.4 billion at the same stage last year.\n----------\nStandard & Poor's late Tuesday cut its long-term credit ratings on a number of European lenders, including Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland Group and Standard Chartered, because the ratings agency thinks state aid in the event of a crisis is now unlikely due to measures taken by European and domestic authorities. S&P downgraded the long-term credit ratings of Barclays and Lloyds to BBB from A-, while RBS' long-term credit rating was downgraded by two notches to BBB-. HSBC's long-term credit rating was lowered to A from A+, while Standard Chartered's was downgraded to A- from A.\n----------\nNo progress was made in negotiations between Royal Dutch Shell and union leaders in the US on Tuesday, Reuters reported, as they continued haggling over a new wage contract for US refinery workers who have been on strike since the weekend. The two camps have been at an impasse since the United Steelworkers union called for industrial action on Sunday for the first time since 1980 at nine plants, which represent a combined 10% of US refining capacity, after saying Shell had walked away from the negotiating table when the talks broke down.\n----------\nCOMPANIES - FTSE 250\n----------\nSynergy Health said it is trading in line with its expectations for the year on the back of a rise in revenue in the first nine months. The FTSE 250-listed company, which provides outsourced support services to healthcare-related markets, said its revenue for the first nine months of its financial year to December 28 was up 5.7% to GBP303.1 million. It said its revenue was held back in part by sterling strength, with constant currency revenue for the period up 9.6%.\n----------\nChemical manufacturer Victrex said it \"has seen a solid start to 2015\", reporting a rise in revenue during the first quarter of its financial year, driven by increased sales volumes from its consumer electronics business. In the first quarter to the end of December, Victrex generated GBP59.8 million in revenue, a 14% rise from GBP52.4 million a year earlier. The company said sales volumes of its polymers rose 42% in the quarter to 967 tonnes from 679 tonnes a year earlier. The strong volume comparative in the first quarter largely reflects the company's current consumer electronics business, which did not contribute to the quarter last year, it said.\n----------\nCOMPANIES - LONDON MAIN MARKET AND AIM\n----------\nRyanair Holdings reported strong growth in passenger numbers in January, and said its planes were more full than a year earlier, confirming a trend it reported on Monday when it reported its third quarter results. Europe's largest low-cost carrier said passenger numbers were up by 1.3 million on the year in January to over 5.98 million, while its load factor rose to 83%, from 71% a year earlier. Passenger numbers in the 12 months to the end of January were 87.8 million, up 8% on the previous 12 months.\n----------\nDaily Mail and General Trust reported a rise in underlying revenue for the first quarter, with revenue increasing in its business-to-business arm but falling for its dmg media newspaper business. The company said its revenue for the first quarter to the end of December was GBP476 million, up 1% year-on-year on an underlying basis. Underlying revenue growth in its business-to-business arm, which comprises its Risk Management Solutions, dmg information, and dmg events arms, as well as Euromoney Institutional Investor, was up 4% for the quarter. Revenue for the dmg media newspaper business was down 2% on an underlying basis, with circulation revenue falling 4% on the back of declining volumes. MailOnline digital advertising revenue rose 21% in the quarter, but print advertising revenue fell 10%.\n----------\nSelf-storage company Lok'nStore Group reported strong trading in the first half of its financial year, with its self-storage revenue rising and document storage business improving. The company said trading in the first half to the end of January \"remained brisk\". First-half revenue in its core self-storage business was up 16% year-on-year, with its self-storage unit occupancy rate up 5.5% year-on-year at the end of January. Its average price per square foot let for the half was up 6.7% year-on-year.\n----------\nInterior furnishings company Walker Greenbank said it expects its pretax profit to come in at the top end of analysts' consensus for the year on the back of a rise in sales. The company said it has performed well since its half-year results were published in October and expects group sales for the full year to January 31 to be up 6.4% to GBP83 million. As a result, it expects adjusted pretax profit for the year to be at the top end of analyst guidance. According to Morningstar, the consensus guidance for the group's pretax profit is GBP7.7 million.\n----------\nAnglo Pacific Group said it has bought a royalty interest on coal sales from a major coal mine in Australia for USD65 million in cash and shares, said it will help fund the deal with a share placing, and also proposed an enhanced dividend policy to reflect the deal. In a statement, the resources company said it has agreed with a private party to buy its royalty interest in the Narrabri coal project, a thermal coal and pulverised coal injection mine located in New South Wales, Australia. The royalty entitles the holder to royalty payments equal to 1% of gross revenue on all coal produced from the area covered by the royalty.\n----------\nMedia company Future said it has made a solid start to 2015, with trading in line with the end of 2014 so far. Chairman Peter Allen is set to tell the company's annual general meeting that trading for the company has made a \"solid and encouraging\" start to the year.\n----------\nCOMPANIES - INTERNATIONAL\n----------\nDiversified media and entertainment conglomerate Walt Disney said its first quarter profit rose 19% from last year, driven mainly by higher attendance at its domestic theme parks and strong sales of merchandise based on the 2013 box-office hit \"Frozen\". The company's quarterly earnings per share also handily beat analysts' estimate as did its quarterly revenue. Meanwhile, Disney is postponing the opening of its Disneyland Shanghai theme park to the first half of 2016, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier Tuesday. The company had planned to open the park in 2015. The project has been on the works for more than a decade, and was first slated to open in 2008.\n----------\nJM Smucker announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Big Heart Pet Brands in cash and stock transaction valued at approximately USD5.8 billion, which includes about USD2.6 billion of net debt. Big Heart Pet Brands, which changed its name from Del Monte Corp last year, is a stand-alone producer, distributor, and marketer of pet food and pet snacks in the US.\n----------\nJapanese auto major Toyota Motor reported that its third-quarter net income attributable to the company rose to JPY600.00 billion from the previous year's JPY525.4 billion. Quarterly net revenue grew to JPY7.170 trillion from JPY6.585 trillion last year. Looking ahead for fiscal 2015, the company now expects net income attributable to the company to be JPY2.13 trillion and net revenue JPY27.00 trillion.\n----------\nSony announced its consolidated financial results forecast for the third quarter ended December 31, 2014. Income before income taxes is expected to increase JPY76.4 billion year-on-year to JPY164.7 billion.

I don't think you do that if you don't have increased confidence in your outlook and you have your expenses under full control.\"\nShire said it now expected its earnings growth for the year to be in the mid-to-high single digit range, up from its forecast of mid single digits in April.\nShire has shown interest in buying Actelion, Europe's biggest biotech company, it was reported in June.

  "articleText" : "Deals | Mon Jan 11, 2016 | 5:30pm EST\nDrugmaker Shire to buy Baxalta for $32 billion after six-month pursuit\nBy Ben Hirschler and Paul Sandle | LONDON\nLONDON Drugmaker Shire Plc (SHP.L) clinched its six-month pursuit of Baxalta International Inc BXLT.N on Monday with an agreed $32 billion cash and stock offer, catapulting it to a leading position in treating rare diseases.\nThe London-listed group, which first approached the U.S. company with an all-stock offer in July, won over the maker of treatments for rare blood conditions, cancers and immune system disorders after adding a cash sweetener.\nShire's U.S.-traded shares (SHPG.O) fell 9 percent, however, as investors worry about a potential competitive threat from Roche ROG.VX to Baxalta's critically important haemophilia franchise, and on nerves over the price offered and a cost savings forecast that Jefferies analysts called \"somewhat disappointing.\"\nThe deal marks a strong start to mergers and acquisitions in healthcare in 2016 after the sector had its biggest deal-making streak in history last year, with global transactions totaling $673 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nIt also highlights the appeal of medicines for rare diseases targeting small groups of patients for which drugmakers can charge hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.\n\"Together we will have the number one platform in rare diseases with a strong foundation for future growth,\" Shire Chief Executive Officer Flemming Ornskov told reporters, after unveiling his company's most ambitious acquisition yet.\nShareholders will receive $18 in cash and 0.1482 Shire American depositary share per Baxalta share, implying a total value of $45.57 per share based on Jan. 8 prices. That is 37.5 percent above Baxalta's price on Aug. 3, before Shire went public with its interest.\nIllinois-based Baxalta, which was spun off last year from Baxter International Inc (BAX.N), rejected Shire's previous $30 billion all-stock offer in August, arguing it significantly undervalued the company.\nBut Ornskov relentlessly pursued Baxalta, seeking to pressure it into agreeing to a deal by meeting with Baxalta's major shareholders over a period of months.\nThat enabled it to sidestep a hostile deal in which it would have faced takeover defences including a \"poison pill\" that stopped unwanted suitors from buying more than 10 percent of the company and a hard-to-replace board.\nShares of Baxalta closed down 2.3 percent at $39.10 on the New York Stock Exchange, giving back earlier gains.\nTAX BENEFITS\nShire had initially offered only stock due to concerns a cash element might jeopardize the tax-free status of Baxalta's spin-off from Baxter. However, Ornskov said he was confident that adding $18 in cash would maintain this tax-free status.\n\"We came out without any doubt that this was not jeopardising the tax-free nature of the spin,\" Ornskov said.\nTogether, the two companies said they expected to deliver double-digit sales growth with more than $20 billion in annual revenue by 2020.\nWith annual operating cost synergies of more than $500     million, additional revenue synergies and tax benefits from Shire's Irish domicile, Shire said it expected the transaction to boost non-GAAP diluted earnings from 2017.\nBaxalta brings Shire a strong position in haemophilia treatments, although that could face a serious challenge by late 2017 or 2018 from Roche's experimental antibody ACE910 that received breakthrough designation - given to potentially important advances over current treatments - from U.S. health regulators. The Roche drug has a long half-life that could allow for less frequent dosing.\n\"A lot of people don't like the deal\" largely due to its  dependence on Baxalta's haemophilia franchise, said John Boris, analyst with Suntrust Robinson Humphrey.\n\"They believe Shire is buying an asset that is going to be under pressure, so it may not reach the $20 billion revenue by 2020 target,\" Boris said.\nUBS analysts cautioned that Baxalta could actually dilute Shire earnings from 2019 to 2023 before being accretive again from 2024.\nThanks to its base in Dublin, the combined company is expected to have an effective tax rate of 16 to 17 percent by 2017, down from around 23 percent for Baxalta, making the deal the latest transaction to result in lower tax rates.\nOrnskov has stepped up his acquisition efforts in the rare diseases space after a planned takeover by U.S. drugmaker AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N) fell through last year. He bought NPS Pharmaceuticals for $5.2 billion in February and Dyax for $5.9 billion in November.\nShire signed an $18 billion facility to help finance its latest purchase.\nShire was advised by Evercore, Morgan Stanley, Barclays and Deutsche Bank. Baxalta was advised by Goldman Sachs and Citi.\nAccording to Freeman/Thomson Reuters estimates, Shire's advisers could be in line for fees of $50 million-$60 million and Baxalta's may earn $70 million-$80 million.\nBaxalta said the termination fee on the Shire merger was equal to $369 million.\n(Additional reporting by Caroline Humer and Bill Berkrot in New York and Anjuli Davies in London; Editing by Keith Weir and Matthew Lewis)\nA sign sits in front of Shire's manufacturing facility in Lexington, Massachusetts July 18, 2014.

It was only spun off from Baxter International last month.\nIf Shire were to sweeten the offer, however, it might be open to negotiations, said one person familiar with the U.S. company.\nShare price fluctuations since Aug. 3 mean Shire's offer is currently worth around $42.50.\n($1 = 0.9139 euros)   (Additional reporting by Nishant Kumar and Greg Roumeliotis.

REUTERS/Ricardo Moraes\nBy Stephen Eisenhammer | RIO DE JANEIRO\nRIO DE JANEIRO Brazil's Vale SA said on Sunday it will appeal a court decision to freeze some of it and BHP Billiton's Brazilian assets, saying the ruling, which declared the two mining companies responsible for a dam burst last month, was \"inappropriate.\"\nVale said it had still not been officially notified of the decision, which was issued late Friday, but understood the ruling to mean it could not sell or transfer mining rights. It should not impact on production, Vale said.\nFriday's ruling judged that the Vale-BHP joint venture Samarco, which operated the mine where the dam breach occurred, did not have the funds to pay for the 20 billion reais ($5.03 billion) sought by the government in damages and subsequently the responsibility must be shared with its owners.\nBHP said on Saturday it had not been notified of the decision. The consequences for the world's largest mining company are likely to be less far-reaching than for Vale, however, as BHP does not have any assets in Brazil other than Samarco, whose operations have already been suspended due to the accident.\nThe dam burst, which turned into Brazil's worst ever environmental disaster, killed 16 people, left hundreds homeless and polluted a river 800 km (500-miles) long that flows across two states.\nThe federal judge behind the ruling, Marcelo Aguiar Machado, imposed a number of other requirements too. These include Samarco to make an initial deposit of 2 billion reais within 30 days to cover the clean-up process. If the deadline is missed, the companies will face a fine of 1.5 million reais for each day the balance remains unpaid.\nThe companies must also map out an extensive clean-up plan and work out how to stop mud from contaminating sources of mineral water. Failure to meet deadlines on these requirements, and others listed in the judgment, face a daily fine of 150,000 reais.\n(The story has been refiled to correct paragraph two saying Vale now says it understands the ruling to mean it cannot sell or transfer mining rights, rather than banning it from extracting iron ore.)\n(Reporting by Stephen Eisenhammer; Editing by Diane Craft)\nNext In Internal Reuters News Room Exclusives And Wins MOL\n",

  "articleText" : "Published: Feb 22, 2016 8:21 p.m. ET\nShare\nBy\nRhiannonHoyle\nSYDNEY--Mining giant BHP Billiton Ltd. slashed its dividend, scrapping a pledge to keep the payout steady or rising, after recording a $5.67 billion first-half loss due in part to a massive write down of U.S. energy assets.\nIn the clearest sign yet of the deteriorating backdrop for the global mining industry, BHP--the world's largest mining company by market value--bowed to pressure by slashing its midyear dividend by 74% to 16 cents a share. It said the move would safeguard its balance sheet during what it expects will be a \"prolonged\" period of low commodity prices.\nBHP Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie had told analysts as recently as last August that contemplating a dividend cut would be \"over my dead body sounds a little strong, but it is almost right.\" On Tuesday, he said it would offer shareholders at least 50% of underlying profits each fiscal half \"to help BHP Billiton manage volatility.\"\nThe company's American depositary receipts were off 3% in after-hours trading in New York on Monday after gaining 5.5% to $25.29 at 4 p.m. The company disclosed the dividend cut after the end of regular trading in New York.\nOther leading miners and energy giants, including Rio Tinto PLC, Glencore PLC and ConocoPhillips, have cut shareholder payouts in recent months amid a prolonged downturn in prices for commodities from iron ore to crude oil to coal as China's appetite for raw materials declined.\n\"While the continued development of emerging economies will underpin longer-term demand growth for commodities, we now believe the period of weaker prices and higher volatility will be prolonged,\" said BHP Chairman Jac Nasser.\nThe Melbourne-based miner also said two top executives, iron-ore unit President Jimmy Wilson and its petroleum unit chief Tim Cutt, would leave as part of a management shake-up. A former Exxon Mobil Corp. executive, Mr. Cutt was named president of the petroleum operation less than three years ago while Mr. Wilson has been with BHP for more than two decades.\nBHP's energy acquisitions about when oil and gas prices peaked have compounded its mining woes. On Tuesday, it recorded a $4.9 billion impairment charge against its U.S. onshore gas business. It was the biggest write down on a single asset in BHP's history.\nIts first half loss included an $858 million charge against the Samarco iron-ore mine that it jointly owns with Vale SA. The collapse last November of a dam built there to hold residue from the mining process released an avalanche of sludge that killed 19 people and polluted more than 400 miles of rivers.\nBHP said that talks are ongoing between the miners and government officials, aimed at reaching an agreement on how to manage and fund environmental and socioeconomic rehabilitation of the area.\nIt said Dean Dalla Valle, chief commercial officer, would relocate to Brazil to oversee the Samarco clean up as part of the management overhaul. BHP said changes to its executive team are part of its efforts to simplify its business structure mainly around geographies rather than major metals and minerals commodities.\nMike Henry, formerly president of BHP's Australia-focused coal unit, will run nearly all its operations in Australia, including iron ore and the Olympic Dam copper-gold-uranium mine.\nIn iron ore, an aggressive expansion by BHP and its main rivals, Rio and Vale, has been blamed for a near-halving of prices each of the last two years. BHP said earnings from that division, which still contributes most to company profits, slumped more than 80% to $747 million in the first half.\nMr. Mackenzie said the deepening slowdown in China, which last year recorded its weakest growth in a quarter century, had led to a sharper-than-anticipated downturn in world commodity prices generally.\nBHP's rivals have recently made similar remarks. \"I don't think anybody predicted what is happening in the world economy today,\" Rio Tinto's CEO Sam Walsh said this month.\nBHP first pledged to maintain or increase its dividend every time it reported its half-year earnings at the outset of the commodities boom in 2001. Since then, the company has become one of the most significant dividend payers on the U.K. and Australian stock markets, providing bundles of cash for large pension funds and mom-and-pop investors.\nIn its last financial year ended June, it paid roughly $6.5 billion in dividends. Over the past decade, it has dished out capital returns totaling more than $65 billion.\n\"This is a commitment which has withstood many previous cycles,\" Mr. Mackenzie said in August.\nThe miner had hinted a dividend cut was coming at its annual shareholder meeting in Perth in November as it faced worsening commodity prices and a potentially high cleanup cost following the Samarco disaster.\nAnalysts at London-based Liberum Capital Ltd. reckoned BHP needed to cut its dividend by a \"bare minimum\" of 50% to ensure it held on to its single-A credit rating, which allows it borrow at low rates.\nOthers have criticized BHP's progressive dividend policy given the cyclical nature of the mining industry. Andrew Lapping, deputy chief investment officer for South Africa-based fund Allan Gray Ltd., recently described miners promising ever-rising dividends as a \"joke.\"\nBHP rivals have been scrambling to improve their financial position recently. Rio Tinto earlier this month surprised investors by abandoning its own progressive dividend policy. Vale also recently said it is considering scrapping returns this year for the first time since it was privatized in the late 1990s.\nLast week, Glencore agreed to refinance a $8.45 billion loan facility ahead of schedule to allay investor concerns about its debt pile, while Anglo American PLC unveiled a plan to unload 70% of its assets. Both had already scrapped their dividends.\nWrite to Rhiannon Hoyle at rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com\nMore from MarketWatch\n",

REUTERS/Luke MacGregor\nBy James Davey | BRADFORD, England\nBRADFORD, England The new management of British food retailer Morrisons (MRW.L) got support on Thursday from the company's former boss Ken Morrison to help to diffuse tensions at its shareholder meeting over pay and strategy.\nIn March, Morrisons reported its lowest profit in eight years and said it would cut its dividend. In common with rivals Tesco (TSCO.L), Asda (WMT.N) and Sainsbury's (SBRY.L) it is battling record food price deflation and waging a price war to stem the loss of shoppers to discounters Aldi [ALDIEI.UL] and Lidl [LIDUK.UL].\nChief Executive David Potts and Chairman Andrew Higginson\nreceived the public backing of Morrison at the meeting. He is the 83-year-old son of the grocer's founder, who ran the company for half a century before stepping down in 2008.\nLast year, Morrison had used the company's annual meeting to lambast previous CEO Dalton Philips and to decry his strategy.\n\"It’s a big job to restore the company’s fortunes, please be patient and give management some breathing space,\" Morrison told investors at Thursday's meeting in a marked change of tone.\nPotts and Higginson used their first annual meeting to tell shareholders they would review the company's pay policies in light of a large payout given to Philips, who was ousted in January.\nThe two, both former senior executives at rival Tesco, adopted a more conciliatory approach after previous annual meetings turned into heated affairs.\nHigginson said it looked like voters would approve the company's remuneration report but said in light of a significant vote against it, they would review future policies.\nHe also noted concerns about Philips' leaving package, which including payoff, bonus, salary and other benefits totalled more than 3 million pounds ($4.6 million), and said this was the minimum that could be paid under his contract.\nPotts has taken steps to get Morrison onside. The former boss told Reuters last month that Potts has sought his counsel and the pair have toured stores together.\nMorrison told the meeting on Thursday he had recommended to Potts that some former colleagues return to the company.\nMorrison's wider family own about 10 percent of the retail group's equity.\n($1 = 0.6490 pounds)\n(Reporting by James Davey; writing by Kate Holton; editing by Jane Merriman)\nNext In Business News\n",

REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko\n2/2\nBy Sinead Cruise and Tiisetso Motsoeneng | LONDON/JOHANNESBURG\nLONDON/JOHANNESBURG Barclays (BARC.L) raised 603 million pounds on Thursday by selling a 12.2 percent stake in Barclays Africa Group (BGAJ.J), a crucial first step in a plan to curb risk and refocus on core markets in Britain and United States.\nBarclays' retreat from Africa may include selling the remaining 50.1 percent stake to a strategic investor, with former Barclays' boss Bob Diamond already lining up financing.\nThat would end more than a century of involvement by the British lender in the continent, whose growth prospects were dealt a blow in 2014 when the price of oil and other commodities - export mainstays of many African economies - collapsed.\nThe sale is also part of the bank's plan to simplify its structure, shore up its balance sheet and generate higher shareholder returns. Barclays held a 62 percent holding in the company before the placement.\nThe sale of 103 million shares, priced at 126 rand each - a discount of 6.5 percent to Thursday's closing price - was oversubscribed multiple times and attracted \"very high quality demand\" from domestic and international investors, a source familiar with the matter said.\nShares in Barclays Africa dropped as much as 4 percent before recouping some of the losses to close 2.3 percent lower at 131.60 rand.\n\"It does seem like a discount but it is also a large chunk of stock that is listed in an environment that has certainly been very volatile,\" said Lentus Asset Management's Chief Investment Officer Nic Norman-Smith. \"It's kind of 'just get me out'\"\nBarclays did not give details of the investors who took part in the placing but a source familiar with the matter said the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) took up 10.3 million shares, or a tenth of the $876 million, the most by a single investor.\nPIC, Africa's largest fund manager with more than $122 billion of South African government employee pension assets in its custody, will now own almost 7 percent of the Barclays Africa. It was already the second biggest shareholder in Barclays Africa before the transaction.\nThe PIC has an option to increase its holding beyond 7 percent without seeking further regulatory approval, the source said. Investors who took part in the placement were pre-approved by the South African Reserve Bank, the source said.\nThe asset management arm of Anglo-South African insurer Old Mutual, a top 10 investor in Barclays Africa, was also among investors that took part in the private placement, its spokesman said.\nDIAMOND\nThe window may still be open for Atlas Mara, an Africa-focused financial services company, to a launch a bid for Barclays' entire remaining stake in Barclays Africa, South Africa's No.3 lender with a market value of 114 billion rand ($7.62 billion).\nThe stake is worth around $4.4 billion based on the placing price.\nValued at $330 million, Atlas Mara - a company set up by former Barclays Chief Executive Diamond - has teamed up with investors that a source has said included buyout firm Carlyle to launch the bid.\nHowever, any deal involving a private equity player will face regulatory opposition from South Africa's central bank, whose deputy governor Kuben Naidoo said this week the bank would not be comfortable with a private equity fund in any of the local banks.\nDiamond has not elaborated on what form the financing he has put together would take.\nBarclays Africa said the results of the private placement showed there was strong demand for its stock and also gave its parent options to sell in capital markets or to a strategic investor.\nThe deal is expected to result in a pro forma increase of about 10 basis points in Barclays' common equity tier 1 ratio, a key measure of the bank's financial strength. Shares in the bank, which have fallen 25 percent so far this year, closed 0.9 percent lower at 160.95 pence.\n($1 = 14.9599 rand)\n(Additional reporting by TJ Strydom in Johannesburg; Editing by Adrian Croft)\nNext In Business News\n",

The agency is pushing towns like Shannon in western Ireland as ideal destinations for administrative employees because they offer low costs and ample office space, one of the people said.\nThe U.K. will vote June 23 on whether to remain part of the EU. London’s financiers have warned a so-called Brexit vote will prompt overseas banks to move jobs elsewhere, because some financial products\ncan’t be traded outside the EU without specific agreements.\n“Brexit could initially challenge the current operational structures of some U.K. and international banks which do cross-border business” and require “re-engineering to ensure access to the single market,” Carlos Suarez Duarte, an analyst at Moody’s Investors Service, said in a report this month.\nIDA Chief Executive Officer Martin Shanahan told the Irish Independent newspaper in March that he had met with “some financial services companies” and discussed Brexit, without providing specifics.\n“Encouraging investment into regional locations outside of Dublin is a key part of the IDA Ireland’s strategy,” the agency said in an e-mailed statement Monday, declining to comment further. Standard Chartered and RBS declined to comment.\nIDA Ireland, based in Dublin, is charged with luring overseas firms to the country, which has a 12.5 percent corporate tax rate, the lowest in Western Europe. More than 1,200 foreign companies, including Facebook Inc., Apple Inc. and Pfizer Inc., have operations in Ireland, and the government wants 900 new “investments” by 2019, according to the state agency’s website. Amid a dearth of office space in Dublin, the IDA is building so-called “advance office facilities” outside the capital.\nBanks that have moved some operations to Ireland include Credit Suisse Group AG, which said in December that it will make Dublin its primary hub for servicing hedge funds in Europe and move staff from London. The company, which considered London before settling on Ireland, will employ about 100 people in connection with the trading floor.\nFinancial CEOs who have discussed the implications of Brexit include Stuart Gulliver of HSBC Holdings Plc, who said in February that the lender would probably need to move about 1,000 investment bankers linked to operations governed by MiFID II, the EU rules covering everything from derivatives trading to bond pricing, to Paris.\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

No clear production or investment targets are expected to be included in the deal, they said.\nState-owned China National Petroleum Corp is Asia's largest oil producer and parent of PetroChina Co Ltd.\nBP will also seek to use the alliance to expand its operations in China, which have been limited mainly to a fuel retail joint venture. Its peers Royal Dutch Shell and Total have natural gas operations with CNPC.\nFor CNPC, the alliance could offer opportunities also to deepen operations in the North Sea and West Africa, where BP has extensive operations.\nA BP spokesman declined to comment. CNPC was not immediately available to comment.\nThe British government wants to use Xi's Oct. 19-23 visit to tighten cooperation between the two countries with a number of economic and cultural agreements.\nBritain hopes to sign an agreement with Chinese utility companies CGN and CNNC to finance the construction of two nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point. It was unclear, however, whether the long-mooted deal would be inked during the trip, China's ambassador Liu Xiaoming told reporters.\nXi's state visit, during which he will dine at Buckingham Palace, marks a significant improvement in ties between the two countries after Prime Minister David Cameron angered Beijing in 2012 by meeting the Dalai Lama.

This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.\n51.5085-0.12574\nLONDON (AP) — Cost-cutting and a solid performance from the refining and marketing arm helped British energy producer BP cushion the hit from low oil prices in the first quarter.\nThough the company reported a 79 percent slide in earnings, its share price spiked 4.5 percent higher Tuesday to 377 pence as the result was better than anticipated in markets.\nBP reported that its underlying replacement cost profit — the oil industry standard, which excludes non-operational items and the value of oil inventories — dropped to $532 million from $2.58 billion in the first quarter of 2015. Though that's quite a precipitous decline, the result was about $100 million better than analysts had forecast.\nBP also said it would maintain its dividend at 10 cents a share — a key factor as the stock is held by many pension funds.\n\"We think the key takeaway is the strong message on dividend sustainability today,\" brokerage firm Bernstein said in a statement. \"BP is clearly delivering on its cost reduction plans which are offsetting commodity price weakness and delivering earnings and cash flow ahead of expectations.\"\nOil companies rushed to cut costs and curtail investment as oil prices tanked over the past year-and-a-half, striking 12-year lows in January. Though prices have recovered somewhat since, they remain well below the $100 a barrel posted as recently as September 2014. Brent crude, the benchmark for international oil, traded at $44.82 a barrel on Tuesday, up from the $34 a barrel average in the first quarter but down from $54 in the first quarter of 2015.\nIn recent years, much of the profitability of major oil producers like BP has come from high oil prices. Because of the lower oil price environment, they have sought to keep a lid on costs. BP said Tuesday it had reduced cash costs by $4.6 billion over 2014 levels and cut organic capital expenditure to $3.9 billion in the first quarter from $4.4 billion a year earlier.\n\"Despite the challenging environment, we are driving towards our near-term goal of rebalancing BP's cash flows,\" Chief Executive Bob Dudley said. \"Operational performance is strong and our work to reset costs has considerable momentum and is delivering results.\"\nThe company's earnings were driven by the so-called downstream business, primarily refining and marketing, which reported an underlying replacement cost profit of $1.8 billion, compared with $2.2 billion a year earlier. The upstream business, including exploration and production, posted a loss of $747 million after a profit of $604 million in the first quarter of 2015.\nIn a milestone for the company, BP said the bulk of the costs from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon accident are now known after a U.S. District Court in April approved a settlement with the U.S. government and Gulf states. BP set aside an additional $917 million in the first quarter to cover costs related to the accident, bringing the total pre-tax charge to $56.4 billion.\nSEE FULL ARTICLE\n",

  "articleText" : "Tesco boss urges rethink on minimum wage and business rates\nShare\nLewis says business rates and wage plans may create \"lethal cocktail\" of costs\nLewis is bidding to turn round the lumbering Tesco supertanker\nThe boss of Tesco ( LON:TSCO ) has demanded a shake-up of business rates and government plans to hike the national minimum wage.\nDave Lewis has called for cuts to business rates to help the supermarket chain to cope with growing online competition.\nLewis also urged ministers to change their plans to increase the minimum wage, dubbed the National Living Wage by Chancellor George Osborne in his summer budget.\nThe supermarket chief says the proposals to increase the £6.50 minimum wage to £7.20 and to further lift it to £9 an hour by 2020 was a substantial extra cost.\nLewis asked for a meeting with ministers to discuss his demands.\nHe reportedly told the annual conference of the Confederation of British Industry lobby group that the wage was boosting pressure on employers to increase base pay at the expense of more flexible benefits such as pensions and staff discounts.\n\"The unintended consequences [of the living wage] have not been fully thought through,\" the Daily Telegraph quoted Lewis as saying.\nLewis is bidding to turn round the Tesco supertanker after big losses caused by accounting issues and cut-price competition from the likes of Aldi and Lidl.\nTesco is closing unprofitable shops and its head office in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, and has reduced loyalty discounts such as shopping vouchers.\nBut Lewis said those cuts and reductions in corporation tax could be eclipsed by a failure to reform the business rates regime.\n\"It is unsustainable and needs a review,\" he was quoted as saying.\nShare\n",

  "articleText" : "Market News | Sat May 16, 2015 | 5:02pm EDT\nUPDATE 1-Seattle flotilla protests Shell's Arctic drilling plans\n(Updates with details from kayak protest)\nBy Bryan Cohen and Victoria Cavaliere\nSEATTLE May 16 Hundreds of activists in kayaks and small boats fanned out on a Seattle bay on Saturday to protest plans by Royal Dutch Shell to resume oil exploration in the Arctic and keep two of its drilling rigs stored in the city's port.\nEnvironmental groups have vowed to disrupt the Anglo-Dutch oil company's efforts to use the Seattle as a home base as it outfits the rigs to return to the Chukchi Sea off Alaska, saying drilling in the remote Arctic waters could lead to an ecological catastrophe.\nDemonstrators have planned days of protests, both on land and in Elliott Bay, home to the Port of Seattle, where the first of the two rigs docked on Thursday.\nKayakers on Saturday paddled around the rig yelling \"Shell No.\" Others unfurled a large banner that read \"Climate Justice.\"\nEnvironmental groups contend harsh and shifting weather conditions make it impossible to drill in the Arctic, a region with a fragile environment that helps regulate the global climate because of its vast layers of sea ice.\nAllison Warden, 42, said she traveled from Alaska to represent her native Inupiaq tribe, which makes its home in the Arctic. She said whales central to the tribe's culture are particularly vulnerable to oil spills.\n\"I don't know what our culture would be without whaling. It's at the center of everything we do,\" she said. \"It's a different relationship than just going to the grocery store. The whale feeds the entire community,\" she said.\nOpponents of the rigs docking in Seattle, a city known for its environmental causes, include Mayor Ed Murray and the City Council.\nShell was bringing in the rigs and moving ahead as planned despite the opposition and a ruling earlier this week by the city's planning department that the port's agreement with the company was in violation of its city permit.\n\"The timeline now is just to make sure the rigs are ready to go,\" said Curtis Smith, a Shell spokesman.\nThe second rig is expected at the port in the coming days.\nEarlier this week, the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management gave conditional approval to Shell's resumption of fossil fuel exploration in the Arctic, which was suspended after a mishap-filled 2012 season.\nThe decision was met with approval by some Alaska lawmakers, who said it would bring money and jobs to the state.

If they sell the business, then it's irrelevant for future profit. What's happening now will be Müller's problem,\" analyst Nicola Mallard of Investec Securities told Reuters.\nDairy Crest, the owner of Cathedral City cheese and Country Life butter, said on Tuesday it secured a three-year extension from Morrisons to provide fresh milk, but supply would be reduced by about a third from March.\nThe company added that it did not expect the lower volumes to materially affect results for its fiscal year ending March 31.\nPeel Hunt analyst Charles Hall said the lost business equalled about 70 million litres, or 10 percent, of Dairy Crest's supply to retailers.\n\"The normal rule of thumb is that volume reduction in liquid milk impacts by (about) 5 pence per litre, which would equate to 3.5 million pounds impact on profits in a full year.

PwC will therefore stand down as the company’s auditors at the conclusion of the 2015 annual general meeting,” Tesco said on Monday.\nTesco said in September it had overstated first-half profits by £250m due to incorrectly booking payments from suppliers, a figure it later raised to £263m.\nThe scandal led to the suspension, then exit, of several senior executives, and sparked investigations by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO), accounting watchdog the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) and a grocery industry watchdog. It could also prompt investor lawsuits both in Britain and the US.\nPwC has not commented directly on the scandal, but said when the FRC investigation was announced in December that it would co-operate fully with the inquiry and was committed to delivering work to the highest professional standards.\nTesco’s new chief executive, Dave Lewis, has since changed the retailer’s relationships with suppliers.\nPwC has been Tesco’s auditor since 1983.

Ultimately, that will become intolerable to shareholders, so we could see consolidation and mergers,\" he said, adding that this was likely to come later in the 10-year period.\nHe said banks also faced a challenge in keeping or attracting the best technology staff, who preferred to work in Silicon Valley or in other industries.\n\"If banks want to really compete for talent successfully, they are going to have to make themselves interesting places to work. It can't just be about the money, because frankly the money isn't going to be there the way it was before 2008,\" Jenkins said.

Shares in Antofagasta added 18p to 719p, Anglo American advanced 16.5p to £12.54, Glencore climbed 2.6p to 288.6p and Rio Tinto edged up 3.5p to £31.03.\nCRH\nOn the other side, Severn Trent slipped 24p to £22.09 despite half-year results meeting expectations.\nEngineering support and outsourcing services Babcock dipped 12.5p to 943.5p after Liberum slashed its target price to 960p from £10.50 citing growth concerns.\nA number of stocks were trading ex-dividend which weighed on the index.

The estate agent cautioned that earnings will be “around the lower end of market expectations”, blaming lower activity in the property market following the EU referendum.

Thanks for following our markets coverage. \n4:41PM\nEuropean bourses close in positive territory\nThere was little excitement in afternoon trade as the US markets remained closed for the Thanksgiving holiday. A rise in metals prices propelled mining stocks higher. \nBy close of trade: \nFTSE100 1 yr\nReflecting on today's trading session, Chris Beauchamp, of IG, said: \n\"Without a clear lead from the US, markets this side of the Atlantic have been trading in a holding pattern throughout the day. Strength in metals prices has once again done wonders for the mining sector, with copper having staged a remarkable rebound from an equally remarkable selloff earlier in November. The entire afternoon has had a sense of children playing about without adult supervision, with this especially clear in currency markets; the dollar is quiet for now, but all that could change by next week.\n\"CRH and Ashtead Group both sit near the top of the FTSE 100; investors continue to pile into these firms on expectations that they may derive some benefit from Trump’s stimulus  programmes.\"\n4:30PM\nConsumers rack up debt at fastest pace since the pre-crash boom years\nBritish shoppers are increasing borrowing at the fastest pace  since 2006, according to new bank industry figures, as low interest rates combined with  high consumer confidence encourages debt-fuelled spending.\nConsumer credit rocketed at 7.2pc in the year to October, the British Bankers' Association said, much faster than the 6.7pc growth in the 12 months to September and well above the 5.1pc growth witnessed a year ago.\nIt is also the fastest pace since November 2006, a decade ago, when credit grew by 7.4pc. That was at the tail-end of a long consumer boom that saw lending to shoppers rise by as much as 18pc at its height in 2002.\nCredit card debts climbed to £62.2bn in October, a rise of £221m compared to last month and up £2.3bn on the year. This is the highest level since late 2010, when shoppers were still widely reducing debts built up in earlier years.\nThe impact of falling interest rates is particularly clear in this part of the market, where there is an intense price war for new customers. Just 56.6pc of all credit card debts are currently incurring any interest payments, the lowest level on record.\nFTSE 100 turns positive in afternoon trade\nAfter spending much of morning trade in the red, the FTSE 100 has turned positive this afternoon. \nDirect Line has charged to the top of the blue chip index, buoyed by a rating upgrade. Meanwhile, a number of stocks are trading ex-dividend. \nThe FTSE 100 is now up 3.83 points, or 0.06pc, at 6,821.55.\nFTSE 100 1-day\nConnor Campbell, of SpreadEx , said: \"After flitting between red and green the FTSE now seems to have settled flat at 6815, meaning yet another day has passed without the index being able to substantially build on its key level.\n\"The pound, on the other hand, maintained some admittedly small gains, rising 0.3pc against the dollar (leaving it just under $1.25) and 0.1pc against the euro (keeping its head above €1.18 in the process). To be fair to the FTSE and sterling, they have both dealt with the Autumn Statement with minimal fuss, something that wasn’t guaranteed given how dire the assessments by the likes of Fitch and the IFS have been.\"\n3:19PM\nDomino's delivers plans for an extra 400 pizza stores\nDomino's has rallied towards the top of the mid-cap index, up 2.5pc to 338.3p, after it announced plans to step up its UK expansion with a store target of 1,600 - up from 1,200. Jillian Ambrose reports: \nDomino’s Pizza is planning to grow its share of the UK market by adding an extra 400 stores to its long-term growth plans in the UK.\nThe pizza giant told investors at its capital markets day that strong sales in the UK meant it had boosted its target for UK stores by a third to 1,600, up from 1,200 outlets previously.\ndomino\nOutside the UK, Domino's plans to open 400 stores in new markets including Iceland, Norway and Sweden as part of its international drive due to start before the end of the year.\nThe ambitious growth plans boosted investor appetite for shares in the London-listed company, which surged 3.27pc to 340.70p by midday.\nThe upbeat outlook from the company follows last month’s bullish forecast for its annual growth in the UK.

It has since regained some momentum and is up 0.12pc on the day at $1.0570.\nBorrowing is back in fashion for FX\nBrooks believes the euro is suffering from \"continued focus on austerity\" and reigning in debt levels across the currency bloc. \n\"This policy is now in stark contrast with the fiscal largesse in the US and the UK, which is a key driver of higher Treasury and Gilt yields. As the spread between German 10-year and US 10-year yields has fallen to more than -2%, the euro has dropped in lock-step. To put this into some context: the correlation between the euro and German 10-year bond yields has surged to nearly 80pc in recent days.\"\nCredit: CityIndex\nTrump could be the biggest obstacle for EURUSD parity\nBrooks also highlights that if Trump's spending plans get \"watered down\" at any stage, then investors should expect \"a major readjustment in financial markets\". \n\"We won’t know this until 2017, for now the market seems happy to ditch the euro in favour of higher yielding currencies like the USD and GBP. If you want to see whether EURUSD will reach parity, then watch the German – US yield spread. If it starts to recover then it could drag EURUSD up with it.\"\nCredit: City Index\n2:09PM\nKey chart: How awful earnings are set to be this decade\nHere's a great chart from Torsten Bell, of Resolution Foundation, which highlights this how dreadful earnings are set to be this decade compared to the last 300 years. \nFor those wanting a sense of history - here's how awful this decade is set to be for earnings compared to the last 300 years... pic.twitter.com/1DBdAB4CjR\n— Torsten Bell (@TorstenBell) November 24, 2016\n Earlier this afternoon, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said wages in the UK will not have risen in real terms for more than a decade in a downturn not seen since the aftermath of World War II. \nIt said that in 2021 wages will still not be as high as they were in 2008 as it criticised the \"dreadful\" impact on workers.\nIFS: It's very possible 'further austerity' will be needed\nThe IFS has also warned that it is \"very possible\" that further austerity will be needed. \n#IFS : Its ver possible [ a one in three chance] that further austerity will be needed.\n— Noreena Hertz (@noreenahertz) November 24, 2016\nThey reckon that there is at least a one in three chance the Chancellor will miss his borrowing target by 2019/20.\nIFS - there is at least a 1 in 3 chance the Chancellor will miss his borrowing target by 2019/20\nWages will not have risen in real terms for more than a decade\nOur live politics blog covers the IFS post-Autumn Statement briefing, Steven Swinford reports: \nWages will not have risen in real terms for more than a decade in a downturn not seen since the aftermath of World War II, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has said.\nThe Institute of Fiscal Studies said that in 2021 wages will still not be as high as they were in 2008 as it criticised the \"dreadful\" impact on workers.\nPaul Johnson, the head of the IFS, also said that there will be an additional \"dollop\" of austerity after the next General Election.\nIFS: Paul Johnson: Very very little for the JAMS.

However, and perhaps more importantly, a Reuters poll of economists taken in November has attached a 75pc probability of the ECB expanding/extending QE on December 8 - just four days after the Italian and Austrian votes.\" \nThis is largely why the Euro is about to set its third straight weekly loss against the US dollar, a run that has seen the EUR/USD rate fall by some 5pc over that period.\nAli says: \"On the one hand this fall does make the Euro look extremely cheap, and why we could easily see a sharp snap-back and recovery.

  "articleText" : "Clinigen Appointed by AstraZeneca to Manage International Global Access Program for New Combination Antibiotic, CAZ-AVI\nShare\nBack to news and press releases\nWednesday, February 11, 2015 (All day)\nBurton-on-Trent, UK – 11 February 2015 – Clinigen Group plc (‘Clinigen’ or the ‘Group’, AIM: CLIN) announced today the initiation of an international global access program for AstraZeneca’s investigational antibiotic, CAZ-AVI (ceftazidame-avibactam), through its specialist Clinigen GAP division.\nCAZ-AVI is being developed to treat a broad range of Gram-negative bacterial infections which are becoming resistant to antibiotics and pose an increasing risk to public health. It is being investigated as a new treatment option for patients with g complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs), complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs) and nosocomial pneumonia. Complicated urinary tract and intra-abdominal infections are often attributed to drug-resistant bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli (E. coli) are particularly adaptive. E.coli commonly causes urinary tract infections affecting nearly three million people per year and has become resistant to an increasing number of antibiotics. cIAI is an important cause of morbidity and mortality, and is the second most identified cause of severe sepsis in intensive care units.\nThe program is the first for Clinigen GAP with AstraZeneca and will provide access to CAZ-AVI to eligible patients for all countries world-wide with the exception of the US and Canada.\nHealthcare Professionals will be able to request the drug for patients who have no other licensed therapeutic alternatives. \nCAZ-AVI consists of ceftazidime, a well-established third generation injectable cephalosporin antimicrobial agent, and avibactam, a next generation non-beta lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor. Increasingly, infections have reduced the activity of ceftazidime. However, the addition of avibactam protects ceftazidime from breakdown, restoring the activity and enabling CAZ-AVI to better meet current and future needs for tackling serious gram-negative infections. CAZ-AVI has been granted a Qualified Infectious Disease product (QIDP) designation by the USA FDA which enables priority review and fast track status.\nShaun Chilton, Chief Operating Officer, Clinigen Group said, \"I am very pleased to announce the launch of this first program for AstraZeneca, further strengthening the relationship with Clinigen. We now work with AstraZeneca across all our operating businesses. The continued growth within Clinigen GAP demonstrates the increasing need for early access to drugs in areas of critical unmet need.\"\nMark Corbett, Senior Vice President, Clinigen GAP said, “The war on antimicrobial resistance relies on the development of novel and improved therapies effective against serious infections, such as CAZ-AVI. We are pleased to be able to use our experience in the provision of international access programs to supply patients with what could be a very important drug. We look forward to working with AstraZeneca to provide access to CAZ-AVI and meeting this area of unmet need.”\n– Ends –\nAbout CAZ-AVI\nCAZ-AVI (ceftazidime-avibactam) is an investigational antibiotic being developed to treat serious Gram-negative bacterial infections. It consists of ceftazidime, a third-generation, antipseudomonal cephalosporin, that is an established treatment for serious Gram-negative bacterial infections, and avibactam, a next generation, non-beta lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor.\nThe addition of avibactam to ceftazidime protects ceftazidime from breakdown by serine-beta-lactamases. CAZ-AVI offers a differentiated profile versus existing treatment options in serious Gram-negative infections through its activity against a broad range of isolates of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and difficult to treat Pseudomonas aeruginosa combined with robust coverage of extended spectrum beta-lactamase-expressing pathogens.\nCAZ-AVI is being jointly developed with Forest Laboratories, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Actavis. AstraZeneca holds the global rights to commercialise CAZ-AVI, with the exception of North America where the rights are held by Forest Laboratories.\nAbout Clinigen Group\nThe Clinigen Group is a specialty global pharmaceutical company headquartered in the UK, with offices in the US and Japan. The Group, dedicated to delivering ‘the right drug, to the right patient at the right time’, has three operating businesses; Specialty Pharmaceuticals (Clinigen SP), Clinical Trials Supply (Clinigen CTS), and Global Access Programs (Clinigen GAP). Clinigen GAP develops and implements global access programs for biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and has provided access to unlicenced, licenced and end-of-lifecycle products to thousands of patients.

Michael Pearson, Chairman of the board and Chief Executive Officer of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc., speaks during their annual general meeting in Laval, Quebec May 20, 2014. REUTERS/Christinne Muschi\nValeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc's (VRX.TO) (VRX.N) ailing chief executive, Michael Pearson, said he was on the road to recovery but was uncertain about when he would return from medical leave.\nPearson, who joined Valeant as CEO in 2010 after a 23-year career at consultancy McKinsey & Co, was hospitalized with severe pneumonia in late December.\n\"As you know, I unexpectedly entered the hospital in late December to receive treatment for severe pneumonia and some unexpected complications resulted in a longer hospital stay than anticipated,\" Pearson said in a memo to employees on Monday.\n\"...I look forward to being back at work when able,\" he said.\nPearson's illness capped a tumultuous year for Valeant as investors turn up the pressure for the Canadian drugmaker to provide a more detailed plan on how it will increase profits in 2016.\nValeant has faced concerns and criticism over steep price increases on some drugs and close ties to a specialty pharmacy that used aggressive methods to overcome insurer barriers to reimbursing its medicines.\nThe Laval, Quebec-based company has since cut ties with the pharmacy and reached a deal to distribute its drugs through leading pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O).\nValeant in January named its former chief financial officer and Pearson's long-time lieutenant, Howard Schiller, as interim chief executive.\nThe move to appoint Schiller came after Valeant said that a  group of company executives would take over for Pearson until he returned, an unusual arrangement that sent shares diving.\nDuring most of the years Pearson led the company, Schiller worked alongside him. The two employed a rapid growth strategy based on a constant stream of acquisitions and drug price increases.\nValeant's shares have taken a battering in the last five months and tumbled more than 66 percent from its August high of $263.70. They were up 0.6 percent at $89.10 in premarket trading.\n(Reporting by Natalie Grover and Ankur Banerjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty and Shounak Dasgupta)\nNext In Business News\n",

  "articleText" : "ViiV Healthcare and Desano Pharmaceuticals’ manufacturing agreement will allow competitive supply of dolutegravir in China and several developing countries\nAgreement reinforces ViiV Healthcare commitment to improving access to HIV treatments\nLondon, UK, 2 July 2015 – ViiV Healthcare and Desano Pharmaceuticals (Desano) today announced a strategic manufacturing agreement to enable production in China of dolutegravir. The agreement will offer an additional source of the dolutegravir active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), and will allow ViiV Healthcare to offer a competitive supply of the finished product (dolutegravir 50mg, marketed under the name Tivicay®) for China and a number of developing countries, subject to national approvals. This strengthens ViiV Healthcare’s commitment to improve access to its treatments for people living with HIV, especially in countries hardest hit by the disease.\n“This manufacturing agreement with Desano for dolutegravir is a significant achievement to facilitate access to our medicines. With our recent agreement with the Medicines Patent Pool and our other access initiatives this deal is aligned with our ongoing commitment to improve access to our medicines in countries where the need is greatest.” said Dr Dominique Limet, Chief Executive Officer, ViiV Healthcare.\nBased in Shanghai, Desano is a high quality manufacturer, therefore well suited to partner with ViiV\nHealthcare. Under the agreement, Desano will manufacture the API of dolutegravir to feed in to the GSK/ViiV Healthcare supply chain for onward sale in China and developing countries covered by the agreement. ViiV Healthcare and Desano are also exploring further options for future manufacture of finished drug product and fixed dose combinations of dolutegravir with APIs.  \n“As one of the leading Chinese pharmaceutical companies dedicated to developing, manufacturing and supplying antiretroviral (ARV) APIs for HIV and finished pharmaceutical products, Desano is honored to cooperate with ViiV Healthcare to manufacture a high quality, competitive supply of dolutegravir and its combinations,” said Ying Kan, President of Desano Pharmaceuticals. “We believe that working together with ViiV Healthcare we can better contribute to the global goal of making treatment options available to patients across the globe.”\nAbout dolutegravir (Tivicay)\nDolutegravir is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) for use in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV. Integrase inhibitors block HIV replication by preventing the viral DNA from integrating into the genetic material of human immune cells (T-cells). This step is essential in the HIV replication cycle and is also responsible for establishing chronic infection.\nTivicay is approved in over 70 countries across North America, Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa and Latin America. A regulatory application for dolutegravir is currently being evaluated by the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA).\nAbout Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in China\nUNAIDS estimates that approximately 780,000 (620,000 to 940,000) people are infected with HIV/AIDS in China.  With more than 40,000 new HIV infections and over 25,000 deaths reported in 2011.1 People living with HIV/ AIDS in China who meet the national treatment criteria are referred to receive care through the China National Free Antiretroviral Treatment Programme (CNFATP).2 Still, only an estimated 126,000 people with HIV were receiving antiretroviral treatment, with an estimated 76% of adults and children who met the criteria receiving antiretroviral treatment.1\nAbout ViiV Healthcare\nViiV Healthcare is a global specialist HIV company established in November 2009 by GlaxoSmithKline (LSE: GSK) and Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) dedicated to delivering advances in treatment and care for people living with HIV. Shionogi joined in October 2012. The company’s aim is to take a deeper and broader interest in HIV/AIDS than any company has done before and take a new approach to deliver effective and new HIV medicines, as well as support communities affected by HIV. For more information on the company, its management, portfolio, pipeline, and commitment, please visit  www.viivhealthcare.com\nAbout Desano Pharmaceuticals\nFounded in 1996, Desano Pharmaceutical is a leading vertically integrated pharmaceuticals company specialising in developing and manufacturing of generic ARV APIs and formulations with 4 manufacturing sites located in China approved by the agencies of CFDA, USFDA and WHO. Desano Pharmaceutical is one of the key ARV APIs suppliers for low to middle income countries, supporting over 4 million AIDS patients treatment. For more information, please visit www.desano.com\nImportant Information about Tivicay® (dolutegravir)\nFDA Indication and Usage:  TIVICAY is a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV-1 infection.\nUse of TIVICAY in INSTI-experienced patients should be guided by the number and type of baseline INSTI substitutions.  The efficacy of TIVICAY 50 mg twice daily is reduced in patients with an INSTI-resistance Q148 substitution plus 2 or more additional INSTI-resistance substitutions including T66A, L74I/M, E138A/K/T, G140S/A/C, Y143R/C/H, E157Q, G163S/E/K/Q, or G193E/R.\nImportant Safety Information for Tivicay® (dolutegravir)\nContraindication: TIVICAY is contraindicated (1) in patients with previous hypersensitivity reaction to dolutegravir, and (2) in patients receiving dofetilide (antiarrhythmic) due to the potential for increased dofetilide plasma concentrations and the risk for serious and/or life-threatening events. \nHypersensitivity Reactions: Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported and were characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and sometimes organ dysfunction, including liver injury. The events were reported in 1% or fewer subjects receiving TIVICAY in Phase 3 clinical trials. Discontinue TIVICAY and other suspect agents immediately if signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reaction develop, (including but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters or peeling of the skin, oral blisters or lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, hepatitis, eosinophilia, angioedema, difficulty breathing.) Monitor clinical status, including liver aminotransferases, and initiate appropriate therapy. Delay in stopping treatment with TIVICAY or other suspect agents after the onset of hypersensitivity may result in a life-threatening reaction. TIVICAY is contraindicated in patients who have experienced a hypersensitivity reaction to dolutegravir.\nEffects on Serum Liver Biochemistries in Patients with Hepatitis B or C Coinfection: Patients with underlying hepatitis B or C may be at increased risk for worsening or development of transaminase elevations with use of TIVICAY. In some cases the elevations in transaminases were consistent with immune reconstitution syndrome or hepatitis B reactivation particularly in the setting where anti-hepatitis therapy was withdrawn. Appropriate laboratory testing prior to initiating therapy and monitoring for hepatotoxicity during therapy with TIVICAY are recommended in patients with underlying hepatic disease such as hepatitis B or C. \nFat Redistribution: Redistribution/accumulation of body fat has been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy.\nImmune Reconstitution Syndrome: During the initial phase of treatment, immune reconstitution syndrome can occur, which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders have been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; the time to onset is more variable and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.\nAdverse Reactions: The most commonly reported (≥2%) adverse reactions of moderate to severe intensity in treatment naïve adult subjects in any one trial receiving TIVICAY in a combination regimen were insomnia (3%), fatigue (2%), and headache (2%). \nDrug Interactions: Co-administration of TIVICAY with drugs that are strong inducers of UGT1A1 and/or CYP3A4 may result in reduced plasma concentrations of dolutegravir and require dose adjustments of TIVICAY.\n- TIVICAY should be taken2 hours before or 6 hours after taking cation-containing antacids or laxatives, sucralfate, oral iron supplements, oral calcium supplements, or buffered medications.\n- Consult the full Prescribing Information for TIVICAY for more information on potentially significant drug interactions, including clinical comments.\nPregnancy: Pregnancy category B. TIVICAY should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk. An Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry has been established.\nBreastfeeding: Breastfeeding is NOT recommended due to the potential for HIV transmission and the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants.\nPaediatric Patients: Safety and efficacy of TIVICAY has not been established in children younger than 12 years old, or weighing <40 kg, or in INSTI-experienced paediatric patients with documented or clinically suspected INSTI resistance.\nPlease visit the following link for the full US prescribing and patient information: https://www.viivhealthcare.com/media/58599/us_tivicay.pdf .  \nTivicay is a registered trademark of the ViiV Healthcare group of companies.\n \n",

REUTERS/Suzanne Plunkett/Files\nBy Steve Slater and Matt Scuffham | LONDON\nLONDON Barclays' (BARC.L) new executive chairman sought to stamp his mark on the bank on Wednesday by accelerating the sale of assets and cost cutting, after the group reported an 12 percent rise in profit and another big charge to compensate customers.\nChairman John McFarlane, who arrived at Barclays in April with a reputation for taking bold action, laid out plans for the bank's revival after ousting Chief Executive Antony Jenkins earlier this month, saying the pace of change had been too slow.\n\"We need to accelerate the execution of the strategy,\" McFarlane said, pinpointing a need to speed up the growth in earnings, return on equity and capital generation, as well as cut out bureaucracy.\n\"Barclays ... remains far too hierarchical, bureaucratic and group-centric to deliver the required outcomes. I therefore want to see much more streamlined processes,\" he said.\nHe said the bank would keep its dividend at 6.5 pence per share this year, the same as 2014, so it can build capital.\nBarclays' core capital rose to 11.1 percent at the end of June from 10.3 percent at the end of 2014, and the bank said it had no need to raise any, which some analysts said it should do.\n\"We don't expect to be doing external capital raises,\" Tushar Morzaria, finance director, told reporters.\nMcFarlane said he plans to cut costs as a percentage of income to \"mid 50s\" percent, from 70 percent in the first-half of the year, which is expected to involve cuts to staff numbers and branches.\nThe bank said it closed 98 branches in Britain in the year to the end of June, or 6 percent of its network.\nIt is in the middle of a three-year plan to cut 19,000 jobs by the end of 2016, including 7,000 in the investment bank.\nINVESTMENT BANK\nMcFarlane also said he plans to cut assets that Barclays no longer wants to 20 billion pounds by the end of 2017. It had 57 billion pounds of these \"non-core\" assets at the end of June and had previously planned to cut that number to 45 billion by the end of 2016.\nThese include derivatives products and its retail operations in Portugal and Italy, which the bank is trying to sell.\nMcFarlane did not signal any major change in strategy for the investment bank, which is expected to be trimmed but remain a core part of the business.\nBarclays shares rose 2 percent to 286 pence by 0802 GMT, outperforming a 0.5 percent rise by the European bank index. Analysts attributed the gain to its capital generation, lower losses from bad loans and a solid performance by the investment bank and credit cards in the second quarter.\nBarclays set aside another 850 million pounds ($1.33 billion) in the second quarter to compensate UK customers, including 600 million pounds to compensate customers mis-sold payment protection insurance products, which has now cost the bank 6 billion pounds.\nThe investment bank's return on equity improved to 10.2 percent in the first six months of this year, from 5.7 percent a year ago. Morzaria said this reflected changes made to reshape it in the past year and no big strategic shift was on the cards.\n\"It (will be) a continuation of that strategy, refining it and looking for areas of further improvement,\" he said.\nBarclays reported an adjusted pretax profit of 1.85 billion pounds for the second quarter, up 12 percent from a year ago and ahead of the average analyst forecast of 1.75 billion pounds.\nThe higher mis-selling provision was largely offset by a 496 million pound gain based on a U.S. court ruling related to the former assets of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers.\n($1 = 0.6403 pounds)\n",

  "articleText" : "Deal allows Portuguese lender BPI to comply with ECB request\nBPI shares suspended from trading by securities' regulator\nShare on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp\nPortugal’s Banco BPI SA said its largest two investors CaixaBank SA and Isabel dos Santos have reached an agreement regarding the bank’s assets in Angola, ending weeks of talks and paving the way for a stake sale.\nThe European Central Bank and the Bank of Portugal have been informed, Oporto, Portugal-based BPI said in a regulatory filing late on Sunday. A “set of contractual documents” will be presented as soon as they are adopted, it said.\nCaixaBank had been negotiating with dos Santos to buy her stake in BPI, according to people familiar with the talks, after last year scrapping a 1.1 billion-euro ($1.3 billion) offer to buy the 56 percent in the Portuguese bank it doesn’t already own. Dos Santos’ holding company, Santoro Finance, has an 18.6 percent stake in BPI. She controls another 2.3 percent through Angolan bank Banco BIC SA.\nTalks started after dos Santos, at a shareholder meeting earlier this year, rejected a plan by BPI to spin off its African operations, which include Angolan lender Banco de Fomento Angola. The move aimed to meet an ECB request for BPI to cut its exposure to the African nation by April 10.\nExpansion Plans\nThe daughter of Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos opposed CaixaBank’s offer last year, proposing instead a BPI merger with bigger Portuguese lender Banco Comercial Portugues SA. She was able to block CaixaBank’s offer because of a rule restricting a single investor’s voting rights to 20 percent.\nSpanish banks including the two largest, Banco Santander SA and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA, are expanding overseas to increase profit as margins in their home market are under pressure from low interest rates and weak credit demand. CaixaBank has been seeking to increase its stake in BPI to help boost profitability.\nBPI shares were suspended from trading in Lisbon on Monday. Banco Comercial climbed 3 percent to 3.4 euro cents at 11:56 a.m. in the Portuguese capital. CaixaBank rose 2.8 percent to 2.56 euros in Madrid.\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

It also raised prices in 2014.\nIn response to the committee report, Royal Mail said there was still much more it needed to do to match the most efficient postal operators.\n(Reporting by William James, editing by David Evans)\nNext In Breaking City News\n",

REUTERS/Bobby Yip/Files\nBy Elzio Barreto | HONG KONG\nHONG KONG UK bank Standard Chartered (StanChart) (STAN.L) could be acquired by a white knight as its recovery could prove to be \"challenging\", according to broker CLSA, which upgraded shares of the Asia-focused lender on that possibility.\nSingapore's biggest lender DBS Group (DBSM.SI) would be the most likely buyer, added CLSA in a note to clients dated Dec. 17. StanChart has seen its shares fall below a forward price-to-book value of 0.5 times this week, making it an appealing target.\nThe lender, which is in the middle of a restructuring under new CEO Bill Winters, has announced a series of moves to restore its profitability, including axing 15,000 jobs and streamlining the bank's management structure.\n\"The bank's road to recovery will likely be a challenging multi-year journey. But the worse the situation gets for StanChart, we believe the more likely it is that a white knight will eventually emerge,\" CLSA analysts Asheefa Sarangi and Lester Lim wrote in the note.\nStanChart declined to comment, while DBS said in a statement there was \"no basis to the report, and it is not on our agenda\". Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings [TEM.UL], the biggest shareholder for both StanChart and DBS, also declined to comment.\nCLSA revised its forecasts for StanChart's earnings in 2015, projecting a loss of $142 million for the year, a first for the bank in at least 13 years.\nThe bank's shares dipped 0.5 percent in early London trading on Friday after soaring 7.3 percent on Thursday, their biggest-one day gain since March. StanChart's stock in Hong Kong (2888.HK) closed 3.1 percent higher, compared with a 0.5 percent decline in the benchmark Hang Seng index .HSI . DBS lost 1.6 percent in Singapore.\nThe slump in StanChart's shares this year has pushed its market capitalization to $27 billion, an affordable level for several banks with regional ambitions, the CLSA report added.\n(Additional reporting by Saeed Azhar and Denny Thomas; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)\nNext In Deals\n",

But despite the rise in production, Fresnillo said its realised price for silver fell by 18% in the half, while its realised price for gold was down 7.4%.\nOn the back of the fall in pretax profit, Fresnillo said it will pay an interim dividend of 2.1 US cents, less than half the 5 cents it paid out a year earlier.\nStill, the group has upgraded its production guidance for the year for gold, up to 715,000 to 730,000 ounces from 670,685 ounces, mainly thanks to production from the now-operational Herradura site.

  "articleText" : "Helge Lund moves to BG a month early\nFebruary 9, 2015 - Commodities\nHelge Lund has started his tenure as chief executive of BG Group one month earlier than expected, weeks after news of his golden hello triggered a revolt among some of the company’s biggest institutional investors.\nMr Lund, formerly chief executive of Statoil, Norway’s largest energy company, was able to make the move after negotiating his contractual obligations with his former employer, BG Group said in a statement on Monday. He had originally been set to join the company on March 2.\nIn December the FTSE 100 group faced public outrage from investors over the size of Mr Lund’s proposed £14m pay package. The board bowed to shareholder pressure and slashed Mr Lund’s initial share award from £10m to £4.7m as well as making other incentives subject to the oil company’s performance.\nBritain’s third-largest exploration and production business behind Shell and BP had been looking to find a major figure to lead the business after a couple of turbulent years and the exit in March of former chief executive Chris Finlayson.\nMr Lund, 52, was lauded in the industry after steering a stellar turnround of Statoil during his 10-year tenure there, guiding it through a merger with Hydro in 2006 and into becoming a sector leader in exploration.\nHe will have his work cut out at BG, originally part of the formerly state-owned British Gas but then privatised and hived off from other arms of the business.\nLast week, the company reported a wider than expected pre-tax loss for the fourth quarter of $8.33bn, compared with $1.58bn a year ago, after being hit by an impairment charge of $8.9bn.\nThe writedown led to a full-year loss of $2.3bn, which the BG Group attributed to the sharp recent falls in oil and gas prices. BG Group shares, which have risen 9 per cent since the start of this year, edged up 0.1 per cent to 935.90p in early trading in London on Monday.\nBG said Andrew Gould, who had been serving as interim executive chairman of BG since April 2014, would return to his role as non-executive chairman.\nThe move by Mr Lund comes five days after Statoil became the latest oil company to cut spending this year and signal project delays after a plunge in crude prices, as it reported a sharp slide in fourth-quarter profit and substantial writedowns.\nMr Lund will be replaced permanently by acting chief executive Eldar Saetre. The 58-year-old, who had held the role since Mr Lund left in October, has worked for Statoil for 35 years and served as both chief financial officer and head of the company’s marketing, processing and renewable energy unit.\nCategories\n",

  "articleText" : "Business News | Fri Oct 30, 2015 | 3:04pm GMT\nRBS warns of higher misconduct charges, obstacles ahead\nBy Matt Scuffham | LONDON\nLONDON Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) said costs relating to alleged past misconduct could be substantially higher than expected, potentially hampering plans by the British government to sell more shares in the bank soon.\nRBS is facing a number of probes into alleged wrongdoing, disrupting Chief Executive Ross McEwan's efforts to turn around the lender that was rescued by a 46 billion pound ($70.5 billion) government bailout during the 2007-09 financial crisis.\nThey include an investigation by authorities in the United States into claims it misled investors in mortgage-backed securities and a review of its treatment of struggling small firms by Britain's financial regulator.\nThe bank on Friday reported a third-quarter operating loss due to restructuring costs and said it expected further charges relating to misconduct and litigation which could be substantially greater than the provisions it has already made.\nRBS, which is now 73 percent owned by the government, has given similar warnings in the past given the uncertainty surrounding ongoing investigations. The bank has so far set aside 4.5 billion pounds to cover regulatory and legal actions, including 2.4 billion for litigation.\n\"Since 2008, RBS has gone through a very difficult period and there are still quite a few obstacles to be overcome before we're back to full health,\" new Chairman Howard Davies, who took up his position in September, told reporters.\nThe ongoing investigations threaten to derail the British government's plans to sell three-quarters of its stake in the bank over the next five years.\nBritain's finance ministry sold a 5.4 percent stake in August, taking a loss of 1.1 billion pounds, and is keen to sell more shares as early as December, according to sources with knowledge of government thinking.\nCourt documents filed in the United States in June suggested the bank could have to pay $13 billion to settle the mortgage-backed securities claims. The bank is being investigated by the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency and Department of Justice.\nSenior RBS executives have said the most damaging issue for the bank's reputation is the investigation by Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) into the activities of the bank's Global Restructuring Group (GRG) turnaround unit.\nRBS was accused of pushing viable businesses into GRG so it could seize their assets and charge higher fees. The FCA has hired Promontory to investigate the claims and the consultancy is due to report back its findings by the end of the year.\nReuters reported in September that RBS executives were bracing themselves for a multi-billion pound compensation scheme after McEwan left a meeting with the regulator in May convinced the bank would face punitive action.\n\"We're waiting to see what comes out of their results so that we can have the dialogue with them,\" McEwan told reporters on Friday.\n\"It's one of those issues that I did say we wanted to tidy up this year. It certainly has some impact on us in terms of the feel around the organisation but I'm not going to give any view on the outcome, we'll wait and see what comes through from the FCA,\" he said.\nShares in RBS were down 1.7 percent by 1220 GMT.\nRBS, which is drastically shrinking its investment bank and international operations, reported a third-quarter operating loss of 134 million pounds ($206 million), down from a profit of 1.1 billion the year before, hit by restructuring costs.\nRBS also said it had raised $2.6 billion through the sale of its remaining stake in U.S. business Citizens. The sale will increase the bank's core tier 1 capital, a measure of its financial strength, to 16.2 percent, the best of any UK bank.\n(Editing by Mark Potter and Jane Merriman)\nA logo of the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) is reflected in the window of a branch office in London November 1, 2013.

REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann\nBy Dmitry Zhdannikov | LONDON\nLONDON Commodity miner and trader Glencore (GLEN.L) has agreed to sell 40 percent of its agricultural unit to Canada's state pension fund for $2.5 billion, the company's latest step to cut debt and soothe investor concerns about the impact of weak commodity prices.\nThe sale values the agricultural unit as a whole at close to the initially expected $10 billion, including $0.6 billion in debt and $2.5 billion in inventories, and comes after Glencore said last month it was stepping up its debt reduction plan by unloading more assets.\nThe group said it aimed to cut net debt to between $17 billion and $18 billion by the end of 2016, $1 billion more than previously planned and down from a peak of $30 billion last year.\nThe purchase is by the pension fund's investment unit, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), which seeks long-term low-risk investments.\n\"Glencore Agri complements our existing portfolio of agriculture assets, bringing global exposure, scale and diversification,\" CPPIB's global head of private investments, Mark Jenkins, said in a statement\nGlencore's stock had collapsed to below 70 pence at the end of last year, a fraction of its peak of 556 pence following its 2011 flotation, due to investor worries over its heavy debts coupled with slumping copper and coal prices.\nINVESTMENT GRADE\nThe stock has, however, doubled in value since then, after the company took steps to cut debt and protect its investment- grade credit rating, by raising money via a share issue, reducing inventories, suspending dividends and selling assets.\n\"Management continue to be proactive and delivering on the stated objective of reducing debt,\" said Charl Malan, portfolio manager at investor and Glencore shareholder Van Eck Associates.\nMalan said that he expects Glencore to continue to drive debt lower via asset sales, metal streaming deals and improved operating efficiencies.\nGlencore expects the agriculture deal to complete in the second half of 2016. The business comprises more than 200 storage facilities globally, 31 processing facilities and 23 ports, allowing Glencore to trade grains, oilseeds, rice, sugar and cotton.\nIt generated core earnings of $524 million in 2015 and had gross assets of more than $10 billion.\nUnder the agreement, Glencore has the right to sell up to a further 20 percent stake. Glencore and CPPIB may also call for an initial public offering of Glencore Agri after eight years from the date of completion, the companies said.\nGlencore Agri would be run by current chief Chris Mahoney and a board to which CPPIB and Glencore would each appoint two directors.\nShares of Glencore rose as much as 2.2 percent on the announcement of the disposal, before retreating to close down about 1.2 percent. The FTSE was up about 1.2 percent.\n\"The more assets Glencore disposes of, the more shareholders will begin to weigh up the benefits to the balance sheet versus the negatives of lost future revenue,\" said Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets.\nBarclays, Citi and Credit Suisse were Glencore's joint financial advisers and Linklaters LLP provided legal advice.

  "articleText" : "Home / News / FCA bans former RBS LIBOR submitter, Paul White\nFCA bans former RBS LIBOR submitter, Paul White\nPress Releases Published: 12/04/2016 Last updated: 12/04/2016\nTwitter\nShare this page\nThe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has banned Paul White from performing any function in relation to any regulated financial activity and publicly censured him. Were it not for Mr White’s serious financial hardship, the FCA would have fined him £250,000.\nMr White formerly worked at the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) as a Japanese Yen (JPY) and Swiss Franc (CHF) LIBOR submitter. The FCA has found that Mr White is not a fit and proper person because he lacks integrity by virtue of his conduct when submitting RBS’s JPY and CHF rates to the British Bankers Association (BBA), which used to administer LIBOR.\nMark Steward, director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA said:\n“As a LIBOR submitter Mr White had an obligation to ensure the submissions he made were proper ones. By allowing his submissions to be set, in effect, by those with collateral financial interests in the outcome, Mr White recklessly disregarded the risk – the obvious risk - that his LIBOR submission might corrupt LIBOR’s integrity.    This ban should reinforce the message that working in financial markets entails obligations and responsibilities and that serious failures will result in substantial penalties including fines and prohibitions.”\nBetween 8 March 2007 and 24 November 2010 (the Relevant Period), Mr White was the primary RBS submitter for JPY and CHF LIBOR. Mr White was reckless in not taking into account the consequences that in benefitting either the trading positions of RBS’s JPY and CHF derivatives traders, or his own JPY and CHF money market positions, or those of external parties, his LIBOR submissions would be improper.\nDuring the Relevant Period, Mr White received 68 documented communications from RBS JPY and CHF derivatives traders requesting submissions that would benefit their trading positions. In addition, between March 2007 and November 2008 Mr White sat next to a CHF derivatives trader who made oral requests for CHF LIBOR submissions to him on a weekly basis. In submitting RBS’s JPY and CHF LIBOR rates to the BBA, Mr White took such requests from JPY and CHF derivatives traders into account.\nMr White also took into account requests received from brokers on behalf of an external JPY derivatives trader when making RBS’s JPY LIBOR submissions. For example, on 22 June 2010 Mr White engaged in a Bloomberg communication with an external broker as follows:\nExternal Broker: \"u got a bit less emotion in the 3's fix [JPY] today?\"\nWhite: \"unchanged should be the call, u want higher?\"\nExternal Broker: \"yah, if not a msve prob\"\nWhite: \"will c what we can do, maybe up a pip\"\nExternal Broker: \"nice, much appreciated.\"\nThe FCA issued Mr White with a Warning Notice on 18 June 2014, but proceedings were stayed due to the ongoing criminal investigation of the Serious Fraud Office into certain individuals who formerly worked at RBS. Today’s ban reflects the FCA’s commitment to protect the integrity of the UK financial system. \nThis is the FCA’s fourth public action against a trader for manipulating LIBOR submissions, and follows fines and bans in early 2015 for senior executives for LIBOR compliance failures. \nNotes to editors\nThe Final Notice .\nThe FCA has imposed 7 fines , totalling £426 million, on firms for misconduct relating to LIBOR.\nOn the 1 April 2013 the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) became responsible for the conduct supervision of all regulated financial firms and the prudential supervision of those not supervised by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA).\nThe FCA has an overarching strategic objective of ensuring the relevant markets function well. To support this it has three operational objectives: to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers; to protect and enhance the integrity of the UK financial system; and to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers.\nFind out more information about the FCA .\nWas this page helpful? *\n",

  "articleText" : "Add Your Note (Optional):\n \nLONDON (Alliance News) - Standard Chartered PLC on Wednesday slashed its interim dividend and said it hasn't decided if it will ask shareholders for new capital, as the emerging markets bank reported a drop in first-half pretax profit and a jump in impairment charges for bad loans.\nStandard Chartered has turned to Bill Winters, the ex-JP Morgan & Chase investment banker, to tackle its problems. Improving the bank's return on equity, a key measure of profitability which fell to 5.4% from 10.4% in the half, is a key focus for the new chief executive, and he said it will take \"primacy\" over growth.\n\"Clearly, 5% is not an adequate return, and even 10% will be marginal to many investors. The board and I consider this to be the minimum acceptable level which we should deliver as soon as possible,\" Winters said in a statement.\nThe emerging markets bank, which makes the bulk of its money in Asia, the Middle East and Africa, said its pretax profit amounted to USD2.10 billion in the six months to the end of June, compared with USD3.25 billion in the corresponding half of the prior year.\nOperating income decreased to USD8.77 billion from USD9.25 billion, and operating expenses fell to USD5.04 billion from USD5.08 billion.\nImpairment losses on bad loans and advances, together with other credit risk provisions, increased to USD1.65 billion from USD846 million.\nPresenting the bank's first set of results since he succeeded Peter Sands as chief executive on June 10, Winters said he is yet to complete his review of the quality of Standard Chartered's assets, with a key focus on the company's past lending decisions and credit portfolio, impairment trends and exposures.\n\"The loan impairment outcome for the first half and the increase in non-performing loans is a continuation of adverse trends, and there are no signs of these reversing. The sources of impairment have been the same that the group identified previously: commodities, China and India,\" Winters said.\nThe emerging markets focused bank halved its interim dividend to 14.4 cents per share, and said it expects to make a similar percentage adjustment to the final dividend. Standard Chartered's common equity tier one ratio, a key measure of financial strength increased to 11.5% from 10.7% at the end of 2014, putting it within its targeted capital range of 11% and 12%.\n\"If we decide we need capital for the long-term benefit of the group, we will raise capital. If we decide we don't need it, we won't,\" Winters said.\nThe new chief executive told journalists that the decision on whether to go to shareholders for capital will partly depend on how the bank fares in the Bank of England's next round of stress testing scheduled for later this year, when the central bank will assess banks' resilience to a global downturn that hits Asia and the euro area in particular. A move to raise capital would also depend on the bank's ability to generate capital.\nJoseph Dickerson, an analyst at Jefferies, which has an Underperform rating and 656.00 price target on the stock, said the jury is still out on a capital raise and that the company is not ruling out such a step.\nStandard Chartered's plans to improve its capital position so far have been based on cutting risky assets that are more capital intensive and on selling poorly performing business. Winters has said he wants Standard Chartered to have the capital strength to give it competitive advantage and the ability to withstand tough economic conditions, and cutting the dividend will help the bank to accumulate further capital.\nWinters said he will set out a \"clear plan of action\" by the end of the year.\nNomura's Chintan Joshi and Alexander Tsirigotis questioned: \"In the near term, the key question for Standard Chartered is will it raise equity?\". The Japanese bank has a Neutral rating and 1,170p price target on the stock.\n\"We regard this as a function of asset quality write-offs and rundown. If Standard Chartered decides that the size of the business currently, in risk-weighted asset terms, is not far from steady state, then it will likely decide to raise equity with [third-quarter] results. If that is through a rights issue, then there is material downside in the stock,\" Joshi and Tsirigotis said.\nWinters has been putting his stamp on Standard Chartered, shaking up the management team and halving the number of regional businesses it has in a bid to improve performance and meet a previously set USD1.8 billion cost savings target by the end of 2017.\n\"Today's results show the group has some very real challenges, but they are fixable and it is important to remember that there is a strong business at the heart of the group,\" Winters said in a statement.\nStandard Chartered shares were up by 4.0% at 991.00 pence midday Wednesday in London. The bank's shares have lost about 47% of their value since peaking at 1,860.50p in March 2013.\nThe bank suffered a \"perfect storm\" in 2014, when investor sentiment toward emerging markets was rocky, commodity prices experienced sharp falls, and interest rates remained low. Loan impairments continued their increase from 2013, when a USD1.0 billion goodwill writedown in its Korean business bumped Standard Chartered off its decade-long path of earnings growth.\n\"Until the recent past, I believe that the group saw most of the challenges it faced as cyclical, and maintained a focus on income and asset growth at the expense of returns. It is clear to me that we are seeing structural changes, and we need to reposition for this reality. Bigger doesn't necessarily mean better, especially if this is impacting returns,\" Winters said on Wednesday.\nBy Samuel Agini; samagini@alliancenews.com; @samuelagini\nCopyright 2015 Alliance News Limited.

  "articleURL" : "http://www.businessinsider.com/tesco-scraps-dunnhumby-sale-2015-10",
  "articleText" : "Tesco\nBritain's biggest retailer Tesco has confirmed it has scrapped   the planned sale of its Dunnhumby data and loyalty unit. \nIn the supermarket's lousy first half results posted Wednesday,   in which its interim profits more than halved, Tesco said it   would retain Dunnhumby following a \"comprehensive strategic   review.\"\nDunnhumby runs Tesco's loyalty card programme, which tracks   customers' shopping habits to build up profiles of consumers and   target them with relevant offers. The Clubcard was credited with   helping Tesco overtake Sainsbury's in the 1990s to   become the UK's biggest supermarket.\nTesco first announced it was putting Dunnhumby up for sale   earlier this year as part of plans to slim down its business   and recover from a disastrous accounting scandal .\nSources told Reuters earlier this year the sale could reach a   value of up to £2 billion.  Potential buyers included WPP , the largest advertising agency holding group, and Google Ventures , as well as a number of private equity firms   including Apax Partners, CVC Capital Partners, and TPG.\nHowever, talks with potential private equity bidders stalled, and   the price of the unit fell to £700 million, Sky News reported . WPP was reported to be the final bidder   left in the sale, but that left Tesco with barely any room to   negotiate over the value of the deal, according to Sky News' Mark Kleinman.\nBusiness Insider has contacted WPP for comment, and we'll update   this article once we hear back.\nAnother issue reducing the value of the Dunnhumby unit was a restructuring of its relationship with US retailer Kroger. The two companies previously had a 50/50 marketing partnership,   but Kroger bought up the remainder and formed a new data and   loyalty unit called 84.51°. Dunnhumby still continues to   operate in the US, with clients including Macy's, and 84.51°   will receive service and maintenance on its Dunnhumby systems for   a further five years. But it meant Dunnhumby no longer had access   to Kroger's data.\nAny buyer of Dunnhumby would suffer the loss of Tesco\nData contracts are at the heart of the issue that saw the   reduction in Dunnhumby's value over the course of the sale   negotiations. If Tesco were to shed Dunnhumby 100%, it would then   need to become a client of Dunnhumby (or another supplier) for   the supply of data and marketing services for Clubcard. Yet the   majority of Dunnhumby's profit is understood to come from   re-selling Tesco's insight and data to consumer packaged goods   (CPG) companies like Coca-Cola and Diageo.\nStuart Evans, director of global loyalty practice at ICLP, told   Business Insider: \"Dunnhumby is like the right hind leg of a   donkey: whilst in place it is a valuable asset but once cut off   from the mothership it’s value boils down to the intrinsic assets   of the data it holds and contracts with the CPGs for insight,   which are all founded on and fed by its live support for Tesco’s   ongoing operations.\"\nThe due dilligence process would have looked hard at what price   Dunnhumby could charge its major \"client\" Tesco for services and   who shares which packaged good companies' revenues once that   amputation had happened, Evans said. Tesco wouldn't have   wanted to pay much (not least because it's trying to slim down   its outgoings) and Dunnnhumby's potential purchasers would have   wanted a big guaranteed revenue stream in exchange for their   cash.\nEvans added \"The remaining value of Dunnhumby outside of the   Tesco’s contract, its people, technology and IP in loyalty will   be attractive to the likes of WPP but that will be nothing like   the £1 billion to £2 billion price tag that was mooted. Even   £700m seems way over the top for the ‘meat’ value of donkey leg   once cut off.\"\n",

  "articleText" : "Deals | Thu Jul 23, 2015 | 4:01pm EDT\nJapan's Nikkei buys Financial Times in $1.3 billion deal\nBy Kate Holton | LONDON\nLONDON Japanese media group Nikkei has agreed to buy the Financial Times from Britain's Pearson (PSON.L) for $1.3 billion, putting one of the world's premier business newspapers in the hands of a company influential at home but little known outside Japan.\nThe deal, struck after Nikkei beat Germany's Axel Springer (SPRGn.DE) to the prize, marks the biggest acquisition by a Japanese media organization and is a coup for the employee-owned firm which lends its name to the main Japanese stock market index.\nIn the Financial Times it has acquired an authoritative global newspaper that commands strong loyalty from its readers and has coped better than others with the shift to online publishing. It was one of the first newspapers to successfully charge for access to its website.\nEstablished in 1884 and first printed on pink paper in 1893 to stand out from rivals, the FT has employed some of the leading figures in media and politics, including Robert Thomson, Chief Executive of News Corp (NWSA.O), former British finance minister Nigel Lawson and Ed Balls, an adviser to former British prime minister Gordon Brown.\n\"I am extremely proud of teaming up with the Financial Times, one of the most prestigious news organizations in the world,\" said Tsuneo Kita, chairman and group CEO of Nikkei. \"We share the same journalistic values.\"\nThe Nikkei newspaper, which has a circulation surpassing 3 million for its morning edition alone, enjoys a must-read reputation for financial and business news in Japan but has struggled to break out of its home market.\nThe paper, with its deep ties to corporate Japan, has also faced criticism for running earnings \"previews\", which are considered to be leaks, days ahead of corporate results at a time when Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s government has been pushing for greater corporate transparency.\nAs the news broke of the Nikkei deal, an FT journalist tweeted a photograph showing staff in their newsroom crowded around a television watching the developments.\nAccording to tweets from journalists who were addressed by the paper's management, FT Editor Lionel Barber told staff the deal \"was not and is not a shotgun marriage\", saying there had been hours of conversation.\nReporters at the paper told Reuters there was some apprehension, as they knew very little about their new owner, but there was also relief they had not been bought by Bloomberg - another potential buyer - which could have resulted in duplication of staff roles and more potential job cuts.\nChief Executive John Fallon told reporters he believed that like Pearson, the new owner had a commitment to the \"fairness and accuracy of its reporting, and to the integrity and independence of its journalism\".\nBOLT FROM THE BLUE\nReuters was first to report on Thursday that the 171-year-old Pearson had finally decided to sell the business daily as it expanded more into education, sparking speculation as to who was the buyer.\nThe name of Nikkei came out of the blue. The FT itself reported that Axel Springer, publisher of Germany's Bild and Die Welt newspapers, was the most likely buyer.\n“We were all frantically Googling Axel Springer to find out who they were...  and everybody was showing off their great German skills. That obviously changed quite quickly,” said one person familiar with the FT newsroom.\nAnalysts and bankers had for years been waiting for Pearson to sell the trophy asset, although the names most closely linked with a deal were financial data terminal providers Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters (TRI.N), parent of Reuters news agency.\nA person familiar with the situation had told Reuters in recent weeks that Axel Springer was working on a buyout, and a spokeswoman confirmed that the group had held talks about a deal.\nThe sale of the FT Group is expected to close during the fourth quarter of 2015 and does not include its 50 percent stake in The Economist magazine or the London headquarters of the newspaper on the banks of the River Thames.\n\"It is hard to argue with the price,\" said Richard Marwood, senior fund manager at AXA Investment Managers, a shareholder in Pearson.\nBarclays said the price represented a multiple of 35 times earnings before interest, tax and appreciation.\nPearson, founded in 1844 as a small building firm in Yorkshire, northern England, was once one of the world's largest building contractors and has had a long list of varied interests from banking and publishing to owning theme parks and Madame Tussaud's waxworks.\nThe sale will leave Pearson as the world leader in education publishing and the owner of a 47 percent stake in the Penguin Random House book publisher.\n(Additional reporting by Paul Sandle; Kevin Krolicki, Ritsuko Ando, David Milliken and Klaus Lauer; Editing by Peter Graff)\nA copy of a Financial Times newspaper is displayed for sale in a newsagent in central London July 28, 2008.

REUTERS/Neil Hall\nLONDON Britain's drug regulators have given the go-ahead for a British American Tobacco electronic-cigarette vaping device to be sold as a quit smoking medicine, the first such product to be given a drug licence in the UK.\nThe decision to licence BAT's e-Voke product means it can now be prescribed on the state-funded National Health Service for patients trying to give up smoking.\n\"We want to ensure licensed nicotine containing products -- including e-cigarettes -- which make medicinal claims are available and meet appropriate standards of safety, quality and efficacy to help reduce the harms from smoking,\" the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said in a statement on Monday.\nThe statement said the e-Voke licence was granted \"recently\", and a spokesman told Reuters it was issued \"towards the end of last year\".\nMany experts think e-cigarettes, which heat nicotine-laced liquid into an inhalable vapour, are a lower-risk alternative to smoking, but since they are relatively new products, there is little long-term evidence on their safety.\nPublic Health England, the government's public health agency, has said it considers e-cigarettes to be at least 95 percent safer than tobacco cigarettes, which cause lung cancer and many other diseases and kill half of all those who use them.\nBAT said in a statement on its website it is \"currently evaluating plans to commercialise\" e-Voke, which uses cartridges containing pharmaceutical grade nicotine.\nMore than 2 million adults use e-cigarettes in Britain, about a third of whom are ex-smokers and two-thirds current smokers, according to the charity Action on Smoking and Health.\nBig tobacco firms, including BAT, Philip Morris International, Japan Tobacco and Imperial Tobacco Group, are jostling for position in the emerging vaping market, which is estimated at around $7 billion for 2015.\nThe MHRA said it would \"continue to encourage companies to voluntarily submit medicines licence applications for e-cigarettes and other nicotine containing products as medicines\" and hoped to see more e-cigarettes and next generation nicotine delivery products submit applications in future.\n(Reporting by Kate Kelland, editing by Louise Heavens)\nNext In UK\n",

  "articleText" : "View the article online at http://citywire.co.uk/money/article/a928512\nAviva, M&G suspend property funds as investors panic\nThree leading property fund managers have 'gated' their funds to prevent investors leaving and worsening a post-‘Brexit’ downturn.\nMarkets\nFollow FundFanatic\nAviva Investors and M&G have joined Standard Life Investments in suspending trading in their big ‘open-ended’ commercial property funds, provoking fears that they believe the post-‘Brexit’ downturn in their sector will be worse than expected.\nThe ‘gating’ of the £4.4 billion M&G Property Portfolio and £1.8 billion Aviva Property Trust means investors in the 'bricks and mortar' funds will not be able to access their money, although they will continue to receive income payments and the portfolios will be managed as normal.\nAs with the Standard Life Investments’ £2.7 billion  UK Real Estate fund, which was suspended yesterday, the companies say they have been swamped by redemption or sales requests from investors worried by the referendum result.\n'Extraordinary' selling \nA statement from Aviva Investors read: 'The extraordinary market circumstances, which are impacting the wider industry, have resulted in a lack of immediate liquidity in the Aviva Investors Property Trust.\n'Consequently, we have acted to safeguard the interests of all our investors by suspending dealing in the fund with immediate effect. Suspension of dealing will give Aviva Investors greater control in managing cashflows and conducting orderly asset sales in order to meet our obligations to investors wishing to redeem their holdings.'\nM&G echoed this in its statement saying: ‘Redemption requests have now reached a point where M&G believes it can best protect the interests of the fund’s shareholders by seeking a temporary suspension in trading.’\nAll three groups say they have told the Financial Conduct Authority of their actions and say they will review the situation in 28 days’ time.\nThey say the suspensions are necessary to give them time to sell properties and generate the cash to give to departing investors.\nThe three funds have held big cash buffers of around 15% for some time, so the fact they have been forced to ‘gate’ shows there has been an intensification in the selling of property funds, which has been evident for some time.\nLast week Standard Life Investments marked down the valuation of the UK Real Estate portfolio by 5%, with Aberdeen Asset Management knocking 3.5% off its main commercial property fund. They followed the example of Henderson Global Investors which on Friday 24 June, the day of the referendum result, slapped a 4% 'fair value adjustment' on the price of its £4 billion UK Property fund.\nPreviously, SLI had been among groups that ‘switched’ their property funds to a ‘bid’ price, which cut by around 5% the amount sellers would receive for their shares.\nFall-out fear\nCommenting on SLI’s suspension of trading, Robert Duncan, real estate analyst at Numis Securities, said the company had clearly been surprised by the rush to sell.\n‘Without wishing to be alarmist or sensationalist, Standard Life’s decision to close its open-ended property fund to redemptions concerns us. With investors already in effect being forced to accept prices which are around 10% lower (and don’t forget the fund was sitting on mid-teens liquidity), there is clearly fear that prices tomorrow will be substantially lower than pricing today.’\nIn its explanation on 24 June Henderson said it had asked its fund's independent valuers to temporarily move to weekly valuation updates, instead of monthly, until there was a clearer picture of market activity.\nHenderson said: 'The UK referendum decision to leave the European Union means that there is less conviction surrounding current prices in the property market and this has been communicated to us by our independent valuers.\n'There is an expectation currently among participants and observers that valuations in the UK commercial property market will face downward pressure following the result.'\nDuncan expressed concern at the potential knock-on effect of the suspensions on the rest of the property market. He pointed out that the amount of money in open-ended property funds had more than doubled to £26.8 billion since the financial crisis. Some funds were ‘gated’ for long periods after the credit crunch after being locked in a vicious circle of falling asset values that threatened to put them in breach of their loan agreements, forcing them to sell properties and exacerbate the slump in the market and the hit to their portfolios.\nOn the stock market, property-related shares fell again as investors worried about the prospects for residential as well as commercial real estate in light of the economic slow down the decision to quit the EU is likely to cause.\nDarius McDermott, managing director of Chelsea Financial Services, a fund broker, said the suspensions were frustrating for investors.\n'If investors need to access their investments in other property funds in the very near term, they may wish to do so sooner rather than later, as some others may follow suit. However, investors should be aware that there will be very high exit charges for doing so, as most physical property funds have already had \"fair value adjustments\" and move from offer to \"bid\" pricing,' he said.\nHe urged long-term investors not to panic. 'Property is still a good diversifier in an overall portfolio and  yields on these funds may also increase, which will be a positive for income investors.'\n",

The courts have said NCR, a New York-listed electronics firm, which previously owned paper mills along the river, was responsible. However, BAT bought an NCR subsidiary – Appleton Papers Division – in 1978 and could be liable for some of the bill.\nAccording to documents, a legal indemnity signed by BAT prior to the purchase appears to be invalid and the company has put £267m to one side to cover the costs. PwC was auditor to Windward Prospects, part of Appleton, at the time BAT bought it in 1978 and is being sued, along with Windward, over the legal indemnity. BAT said: “This situation has arisen as a result of proposed litigation by a group subsidiary against PwC. The potential claims against PwC arose from work carried out by PwC in relation to the audit of the accounts of a third party. These claims do not concern the audit of any BAT Group company.”\nThe tobacco giant added  that PwC rivals Deloitte, Ernst & Young and KPMG were being invited to tender for the auditing contract.\nThe complex details of the legal case are highlighted in BAT’s annual report. But it appears PwC’s involvement in the original purchase of Windward Prospects was only recently discovered.\nFox River has been lined with paper mills for several decades and still has more than 20 operating along its banks.\nHowever, since the 1950s there had been concerns around contamination to the water from the recycling process that saw chemicals used in certain paper ending up in the river. By 2010, the US government filed a lawsuit against nine paper companies over failures to clean up the chemicals and, in 2013, NCR was deemed wholly responsible for the clean-up of the mid and lower portions of the river. This decision is being appealed.\nBAT owned the subsidiary in a period when it had a wide-ranging portfolio of businesses, including a heavy investment in the insurance industry, before turning its attentions exclusively to tobacco ahead of its floatation in 1998.\nPwC declined to comment.\n",

These are familiar stories of big companies recalling products because of new – unintended – changes to the recipe.\nKraft is the latest company to make headlines for recalling a product - 6.5 million of them in fact. It asked customers to return 7.25-ounce packets of its hallmark mac and cheese with a best before in September and October this year in the US, Puerto Rico and the Caribbean after metal bits were discovered in the food by eight separate customers.\nKraft's share price closed down two per cent after the announcement but is since back up to trading at prior levels - suggesting investors were barely alarmed by the news.\nHistory seems to show that though product recall may affect the public perception of a brand, it does not hurt its prospects with investors.\nKraft Singles\nMac and Cheese was not the first Kraft product recall. In August it recalled 7,700 cases of some varieties of Kraft American Singles after a supplier failed to store an ingredient correctly. Back then the share price dipped for two days but was back to pre-recall levels less than a month later.\n \nCadbury\nIn 2006 Britain's beloved chocolate-maker Cadbury-Schweppes recalled more that one million chocolate bars after contamination from a leaking pipe at a Cadbury factory resulted in a salmonella outbreak that infected nearly 40 people. That summer, sales of Cadbury's chocolate fell 14 per cent while Cadbury reported the incident would cost them a hefty £20 million in recall costs, advertising and manufacturing improvements.\nFruit Shoot\nBritvic recalled Fruit Shoot, a brand of children's fruit drink, after a six-year-old boy nearly choked on a loose cap in 2012. A week after the incident, Britvic's share price had slumped 13.4 per cent. By the end of the year, the recall cost Britvic £16.8 million.\nSpecial K\nSome cereal-eaters found their Special K had an extra crunch in February 2013 after glass fragments were found in the Kellogg's cereal. The company pulled 36,000 packets from supermarket shelves as a precaution. Kellogg's shares tanked 13 per cent on the day of the announcement but by the time of the company's third quarter results, profits had gone up because of cost cutting measures that could have resulted in the lax factory standards in the first place.\nHorse meat\nIrish food inspectors found traces of horse meat in frozen beefburgers made in the UK and Ireland in mid-January 2013, resulting in Tesco, Asda and Nestle products being recalled, among others. Tesco blamed the scandal for a one per cent drop in sales in May, however shares in Sainsbury's, Morrison's and Tesco all rose between nine and 16 per cent in the following weeks, indicating that investors and customers alike had brushed off the risks.\n",

  "articleText" : "Standard Chartered share price: Aberdeen CEO would back potential capital increase\nMartin Gilbert praises bankâ€™s new boss Bill Winters\nby Farquar McIntosh Friday, 25 Sep 2015, 09:32 BST\nAberdeen Asset Management Plc (LON:ADN), one of Standard Chartered Plcâ€™s (LON:STAN) largest shareholders, would back a capital increase if the troubled bank decides that such move is necessary, the companyâ€™s chief executive officer Martin Gilbert has said. In an interview with Bloomberg yesterday, Gilbert discussed the lenderâ€™s current situation and spoke highly of its new boss, Bill Winters.\nâ€œI think what Bill Winters will probably do is thoroughly review the business and then decide,â€� Gilbert told Bloomberg. â€œI suspect itâ€™s on a knife edge. If he needs to raise capital, we will be supportive of it,â€�though Aberdeen hasnâ€™t been sounded out for its view, he added.\nStanChart hired Winters in February, hoping that the former co-head of JPMorgan Chase & Co.â€™s investment bank could reverse a two-year decline in the bankâ€™s profits and a plunge in its share price. Winters took over as CEO from Peter Sands in June, leaving the Renshaw Bay hedge fund he set up in 2011.\nLast month the new CEO slashed StanChartâ€™s dividend in half to save $1 billion and help boost the companyâ€™s profitability. Winters said at the time that â€œno decisions have yet been takenâ€� on a capital raise, but added â€œif we decide we need capital for the long-term benefit of the Group, we will raise capitalâ€�.\nYesterday Gilbert told Bloomberg that Aberdeen planned to retain its roughly nine-percent stake in Standard Chartered. The company is StanChartâ€™s second-largest shareholder, behind Singaporeâ€™s Temasek Holdings Pte, which owns about 17 percent in the UK lender.\nGilbert also praised StanChartâ€™s board for bringing in Winters, saying that there has already been a boost in moral at the bank following his appointment. He added that Aberdeen supported the Â£6.3 million joining fee that Winters received as a compensation for leaving Renshaw Bay ( Standard Chartered share price: Bill Winters receives Â£6.7 million in shares ).\nâ€œIf you want to get someone as talented as him, youâ€™re going to have to pay,â€�Gilbert said.\nIn todayâ€™s trading, Standard Chartered shares were up 1.8 percent at 661.97p, as of 08:22 BST. The stock has fallen 31.4 percent since the start of the year and the companyâ€™s market capitalisation currently stands at Â£17.5 billion.\nAs of September 22, 2015, the consensus forecast amongst 27 polled investment analysts covering Standard Chartered had it that investors should hold their position in the company. The same consensus estimate has been maintained since May 08, 2013, when the sentiment of investment analysts deteriorated from â€œoutperformâ€�.\n",

A J P Morgan veteran, Mr Morzaria has the investment banking background which new chairman John McFarlane is looking for in any incoming chief executive.\nHe also has international experience and – as he has been at Barclays for two years – is also gaining the retail banking knowledge needed for the job.\nBarclays’ market statement announcing Mr Jenkins’s departure also cemented Mr Morzaria’s position as a key figure at the top of the bank.\n“Members of the group executive committee will now report to Mr McFarlane, who will work particularly closely with Tushar Morzaria,” it said.\nBookmaker Paddy Power makes the finance director favourite for the role.\nThe announcement of Mr Jenkins’s departure and the appointment of Mr McFarlane as executive chairman shocked the market.\nMr McFarlane, who arrived in April, promised to “re-energise” the bank with the goal of improving returns to shareholders rapidly, and said he would overhaul Barclays’ “cumbersome bureaucracy” to speed up its progress.\n• Barclays' John McFarlane: I’m no axe-man\nA second former JP Morgan executive to have caught the attention is ex-investment bank boss Jes Staley. He left the bank in 2013 to head BlueMountain Capital, a hedge fund.\nAnother investment banker also makes the shortlist, reflecting the shifting focus away from Mr Jenkins’s background in retail banking and Barclaycard, and on to the wholesale arm of the bank.\nAntony Jenkins headed Barclays for just under three years, before being handed his notice by the new chairman (Credit: Bloomberg)\nColm Kelleher of Morgan Stanley is in high demand at his current bank – an extra $2m bonus helped make him the second-highest earner there last year, shortly behind the group chief executive.\nA fourth contender is Mike Smith, who has been chief executive of Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) since 2007, when he took over from Mr McFarlane.\nThis creates a strong personal link between the pair, and Mr McFarlane referred to his own experience at ANZ as evidence he has the experience at a retail bank needed to be Barclays’ executive chairman.\nAnother candidate is Jonathan Moulds, Barclays’ chief operating officer. The former Bank of America Merrill Lynch executive was hired at the start of 2015 to restructure the bank, implementing the ring-fence that divides the retail and investment banking units.\nThe job gives Mr Moulds a head start in terms of understanding the board’s strategy, and Paddy Power has him as the second favourite at 9/4 while Mr Morzaria is at 2/5.\nFollow the Telegraph on LinkedIn.

The U.S. government never sued Halliburton under the Act, one person familiar with the case said.\n\"We have now settled all matters relating to the accident with both our partners in the well and our contractors,\" BP spokesman Geoff Morrell said in an email.\nTransocean said BP would pay the company $125 million in compensation for legal fees it incurred, adding the companies will mutually release all claims against each other.\nThe company added BP will also discontinue its attempts to recover as an \"additional insured\" under Transocean's liability policies that will accelerate the company's recovery of about $538 million in insurance claims.\nTransocean also said it would pay about $212 million to a fund set up to pay out claims to people and businesses harmed by the spill, subject to the approval by U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.\n\"We applaud Transocean for adding to the settlement funds established in the Halliburton settlement to help compensate people and businesses for their losses,\" said co-lead plaintiffs' attorneys, Stephen Herman and James Roy.\nTransocean said it intends to make the payments using cash on hand.\nIn September, a U.S. judge ruled that BP was mostly at fault and that Transocean and Halliburton were not as much to blame.\nHalliburton, which did the cementing work for BP's well, had earlier blamed BP's decision to use only six centralizers for the blowout that spilled millions of barrels of oil for 87 days.\nHalliburton said in September that it reached a $1.1 billion settlement for a majority of claims related to its role in the oil spill.\nLondon-based BP has already taken $43.8 billion in pretax charges for clean-up and other costs.

In a bullish note on the defence sector, the investment bank said: “The world really does feel more dangerous as we enter 2016.”\nAnalysts believe the list of concerns has “grown significantly” in the last few months of 2015, as a result of three major terror attacks, which Islamic State claimed responsibility for, in the final quarter of last year, the power struggle between Saudi Arabia and Iran, and the refugee crisis.\nIn its wake, defence spending has increased in most parts of the world. David Perry, a JPMorgan analyst, said global defence spending rose 1.7pc in 2014 - the first year of growth since 2010. While data is not yet available, the bank believes it also rose last year, and will continue to rise in the next 12 months.\nLast year, the UK, Germany, Italy and Sweden all announced higher defence spending budgets than previously expected. JPMorgan also believes the British government is “more supportive of defence” than it was in its first administration, when austerity was the focus. Sector wide, orders for European-built fighter jets have not been strong over the last decade. However, last year there were two orders for such planes. BAE Systems “will still be pursuing an order for Eurofighters from Saudi Arabia”, the bank added.\nWith jitters about global growth plaguing investors in recent times, Mr Perry said defence stocks are considered attractive due to their “safe haven status”. The rating revision comes days after RBC Capital Markets declared the defence giant its “top pick” in the European aerospace and defence sector, due to a higher-than-expected US defence budget - BAE’s largest end market.\nTwo months ago, the FTSE 100 company warned its 2015 earnings would see no growth, after it cut the rate of Typhoon aircraft production.\nBAE Systems was among the top FTSE 100 risers after a rating upgrade.  Photo: EPA\nOn the wider market, Britain’s benchmark index had another volatile trading session, swinging between gains of 0.5pc and losses of 0.69pc. Investors appeared to shrug off a sharp fall in China’s benchmark Shanghai stock market, which closed down 5.33pc, after China guided the yuan higher , following a torrid start to the new year . Nonetheless, the FTSE 100 closed down 40.61 points, or 0.69pc, to 5,871.83.\nJameel Ahmad, of Forex Time said: “European and US markets are trying to ignore another brutal round of punishment in the Chinese markets overnight, but it is unlikely that they will be able to maintain this.”\nAlthough the blue chip index ended the day marginally lower, Standard Life ticked 0.4p higher to 363.4p, buoyed by a positive broker note. Deutsche Bank raised its rating as it believes Standard Life is one of the strongest life assurers in terms of future growth.\nThe bank’s view of the wider sector is somewhat more subdued. Oliver Steel, of Deutsche Bank, said the share prices of UK-listed life assurers are currently “wading through a morass of uncertainty” over the next few months, due to volatility in financial markets, UK pension reforms and fears of a Brexit. Meanwhile, shares in Prudential slipped 12.5p to £13.64 as the bank believes it faces the “greatest amount of uncertainty” due to slowing Asian growth.\nAnother stock enjoying the benefits of a rating upgrade was Whitbread. Shares rose 79p to £41.99 after Bank of America Merrill Lynch lifted it from “neutral” to “buy” as the bank believe Premier Inn continues to be “relatively resilient”.\nOn the other side, Sports Direct tumbled 7pc to 403p following a rating downgrade from Liberum. In the wake of Friday’s profit warning , the broker slashed its rating from “buy” to “hold”.\nIrish drugmaker Shire spiralled downwards to the bottom of the FTSE 100 - 8.2pc lower at £39.25 - after it agreed to buy US rival Baxalta , a rare disease drug developer, for $32bn.\nThe price of brent crude crashed below the $32-a-barrel mark in intraday trade, dragging oil majors down also. Royal Dutch Shell B shares slipped 1.5pc to£13.55, while BG Group shed 2.4pc to 917.7p.\nWhile Rebecca O’Keeffe, of Interactive Investor, warned there is “no end in sight for the beleaguered commodity”, some sectors may find support from “the positive consumer benefits from low energy prices”.\nDespite dominating the FTSE leaders in early trade, mining stocks edged lower as the price of copper plunged to a six-and-a-half year low of $4,412. As concerns about waning demand from the world’s biggest metals consumer continued to intensify, international mining and trading group Glencore fell 5.2pc to 73.4p. Meanwhile, Antofagasta and Rio Tinto lost 2.7pc and 2.4pc, respectively. Anglo American bucked the trend to rise 0.5pc to 230.5p.\nElsewhere, gold attempted to cling on to gains made last week, when it touched a nine-week high, but failed. The price of gold slipped 0.7pc to $1,096 per ounce as the dollar rose against the euro. In its wake, Randgold Resources eased back - down 1.1pc to £43.51.\nFinally, following a prolonged period of suspension, Management Resource Solutions resumed trading at 2.30pm after it announced the proposed acquisition of Bachmann Plant Hire for £6.5m. In just two hours of trading, shares jumped 41pc to 14.3p.\n",

  "articleText" : "Shell updates on Alaska exploration\nShell updates on Alaska exploration\n28-Sep-2015\nShell today provides an update on the Burger J exploration well, located in Alaska’s Chukchi Sea. The Burger J well is approximately 150 miles from Barrow, Alaska, in about 150 feet of water. Shell safely drilled the well to a total depth of 6800 feet this summer in a basin that demonstrates many of the key attributes of a major petroleum basin. For an area equivalent to half the size of the Gulf of Mexico, this basin remains substantially under-explored.\nShell has found indications of oil and gas in the Burger J well, but these are not sufficient to warrant further exploration in the Burger prospect. The well will be sealed and abandoned in accordance with U.S. regulations.\n\"The Shell Alaska team has operated safely and exceptionally well in every aspect of this year's exploration program,\" said Marvin Odum, Director, Shell Upstream Americas. \"Shell continues to see important exploration potential in the basin, and the area is likely to ultimately be of strategic importance to Alaska and the US. However, this is a clearly disappointing exploration outcome for this part of the basin.”\nShell will now cease further exploration activity in offshore Alaska for the foreseeable future. This decision reflects both the Burger J well result, the high costs associated with the project, and the challenging and unpredictable federal regulatory environment in offshore Alaska.\nThe company expects to take financial charges as a result of this announcement. The balance sheet carrying value of Shell's Alaska position is approximately $3.0 billion, with approximately a further $1.1 billion of future contractual commitments. An update will be provided with the third quarter 2015 results.\nShell holds a 100% working interest in 275 Outer Continental Shelf blocks in the Chukchi Sea.\nOperations will continue to safely de-mobilize people and equipment from the Chukchi Sea.\nEnquiries\nInternational: +44 207 934 5550\nAmericas: +1 713 241 4544\nShell Investor Relations\nEurope: + 31 70 377 4540\nNorth America: +1 832 337 2034\nCautionary Note\nThe companies in which Royal Dutch Shell plc directly and indirectly owns investments are separate entities.

  "articleText" : "City spirits sink after Diageo comes up short with sales slide\nThe drinks giant reported an unexpected slowdown in quarterly revenues\nFriday 17 April 2015 00:36 BST\nClick to follow\nThe Independent Online\nJude Law fronted a campaign for Diageo's Johnnie Walker Blue Label scotch, one of the drinks that has fallen out of favour in Russia Getty\nHopes of a sales rebound at Diageo at the start of this year have fallen flat as the drinks giant reported an unexpected slowdown in quarterly revenues, sending its shares down nearly 4 per cent to 1,896.5p.\nThe results contrasted with those of two other consumer giants, Unilever and SABMiller, which showed recovery in key markets.\nSales at Diageo fell faster in the three months to the end of March than in the second half of 2014. Organic net sales were down 0.7 per cent; analysts had been looking for a 2 per cent increase.\nThe Johnnie Walker to Guinness maker has been restructuring its business and encouraging its trade customers to destock, so that it can adapt better to changing consumer trends. But industry watchers had expected demand to bounce back, particularly in North America, which makes up 40 per cent of Diageo’s total sales.\nIn continental Europe sales were broadly flat, and in the UK sales dropped sharply, due to unfavourable comparisons with last year when the drinks trade was stocking up ahead of an anticipated hike in duty on spirits.\nRead more\nDiageo affected by sliding oil prices in Russia\nIvan Menezes, the chief executive of Diageo, said he expected sales growth to remain subdued this year, due to weakness in international economies, lower inflation and the company’s efforts to strengthen its business.\nMeanwhile, the household goods giant Unilever and the brewer SABMiller issued more positive trading statements than had been expected, sending their shares higher.\nUnilever declared a good first quarter, posting sales growth of 2.8 per cent as emerging markets including China unexpectedly bounced back with sales up 5.4 per cent.\nPaul Polman, its chief executive, had warned the market not to expect good growth this year. But he said the company was now seeing “more tailwinds than headwinds”.\nUnilever shares were 77p higher at 3,011p.\nThe company, which launched new pink-and-black Magnum ice-creams in the UK this week, said it was also launching a cut-price smaller Cornetto across Europe that will sell for €1.\nUnilever said that conditions in European markets remained weak, but that there had been improvement in India, more stable conditions in China and a deterioration in Brazil and Russia, where consumer incomes are being squeezed.\nSABMiller posted underlying growth in revenues of 6 per cent in its fourth quarter, as it provided an update on trading for the year to the end of March. Good weather in the UK helped sales of Peroni lager climb by 4 per cent, and its shares increased by 51p to 3,636p.\nThe world’s second-largest brewer, which also makes Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell beer, pointed to improvements in its businesses in Asia, Latin America and Africa, where sales growth reached 12 per cent.\nLager sales in Europe were hit by the continuing crisis in Ukraine and uncertainties over market conditions in Russia, the company said. Sales in the US were lower, compared with numbers last year, when the brewer launched its Miller Fortune brew.\n",

  "articleText" : "Financials | Fri Jul 24, 2015 | 10:51am EDT\nLondon Stock Exchange unit in talks to operate Plato venue\nBy Huw Jones and Lionel Laurent | LONDON, July 24\nLONDON, July 24 A nascent consortium of asset managers, banks and brokerages is in talks with a London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) unit to provide technology for its planned trading platform, conceived as a venue for off-market trading of large blocks of shares.\nPlato Partnership said on Friday it was in exclusive discussions on a commercial collaboration with LSEG's majority owned Turquoise unit, which already operates a so-called \"dark pool\" venue for large block trades.\nPlato, whose members include Citigroup, Goldman Sachs , Deutsche Bank and asset managers like AXA Investment Managers and Franklin Templeton, plans a dark pool or anonymous trading venue linking its members and other institutions, with profits ploughed back into academic studies to make its platform more efficient.\nDark pools, whose transactions are only revealed once they are completed to avoid unduly moving prices, have come under scrutiny from regulators who want more transparency in trading.\nThe European Union is finalising curbs on the volume of dark pool trading in shares from 2017. However many fund managers are unwilling to give up anonymous trading of big blocks as it helps limit adverse price moves.\nExchanges and trading platforms including Turquoise have already announced measures to accommodate incoming EU rules while retaining some features of dark-pool trading.\nThe aim of the LSEG-Plato agreement is to outsource operations of the trading venue, Deutsche Bank's Stephen McGoldrick, project director for Plato, said in an interview. He declined to comment on specifics of the talks but said that the exclusive talks would hopefully only last a few weeks.\nTurquoise is 51 percent owned by LSEG, with 12 banks owning the rest.

REUTERS/Bobby Yip\n4/4\nBy Lawrence White | HONG KONG\nHONG KONG HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA.L) toned down celebrations for its 150th anniversary on Tuesday, centering events on Hong Kong where it was founded, after being rocked by allegations its Swiss unit helped clients dodge taxes.\nCelebrations include a light show beneath its Norman Foster-designed Hong Kong headquarters, two giant grain of rice sculptures and the issuing of a commemorative HK$150 note. But it has not advertised the events in mainstream financial or local media in its two \"home\" markets of Hong Kong and Britain.\nSenior executives at HSBC (0005.HK) discussed scrapping the plans, after CEO Stuart Gulliver said last month the tax scandal had brought shame on the bank, bank insiders told Reuters. But they decided to go ahead given money had been spent and clients invited.\nThe bank is downplaying publicity especially in Britain, where opprobrium was highest over the Swiss scandal, one of the insiders said.\nA 40-foot-high grain of rice sculpture was unveiled by Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver outside the Hong Kong office, while Chairman Douglas Flint presented a matching one inside the London headquarters.\nThe grain of rice acknowledges the bank's roots as a trade finance bank founded in Asia. The HK$150 note marks HSBC's position as one of four banks that print the territory's currency.\nA 784-page history of the bank entitled \"The Lion Wakes\" will be published on Thursday.\nHSBC opened for business in March 1865 in Hong Kong, still its most profitable market. The bank, whose name derives from the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, moved its HQ to London in 1992 following its takeover of Britain's Midland Bank. Since then it has grown to become Europe's largest bank, with assets of $2.6 trillion at the end of 2014.\nGulliver and Flint last week rejected calls from UK lawmakers for them to quit over the Swiss problems, saying they were having to clean up after a \"terrible list\" of control and compliance failings..\nHSBC has admitted failings in its Swiss private bank after media reports said it helped wealthy customers conceal millions of dollars of assets. Gulliver and other executives are expected to be called before a panel of UK lawmakers next week to discuss the issue.\nGulliver has attempted to streamline HSBC since becoming CEO in 2011. He is axing $3.5 billion in costs, closing or selling underperforming units and focusing, according to its annual report, on becoming \"the world's most respected international bank\".\n(Additional reporting by Steve Slater in London; Editing by David Holmes)\nNext In Business News\n",

Bernstein Ltd. upgraded the bank, citing the hiring of Bill Winters as chief executive officer and a diminishing need to raise capital.\n“We expect the appointment of a new CEO to mark a turning point for Standard Chartered and see plenty of scope for the business to be refocused with a material improvement in returns,” Hong Kong-based Barclays analyst Sharnie Wong, who raised her rating to overweight from equal weight, said in a note. “In addition, there’s an opportunity to allay market concerns on credit quality and the group’s capital position.”\nWinters, 53, a former co-CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s investment bank, in June will replace Peter Sands, who ran the bank for more than eight years. Sands, 53, lost the confidence of investors after he couldn’t arrest two years of falling shares and earnings that ended a decade of growth.\nThe shares in Hong Kong climbed as much as 5.7 percent, the biggest intraday gain since August 2012, and were up 4.7 percent as of 10 a.m. Thursday. In London, the shares surged 8.1 percent on Wednesday, the most since October 2011. They plummeted about 29 percent in 2014.\nCapital Need?\nStandard Chartered, which gets the majority of its revenue in Asia, cut its exposure to commodities by $6 billion to $55 billion in the second half of 2014. Additionally, the bank’s high-risk and distressed corporate loans fell to $9.5 billion at year-end from $10.8 billion in the first half, Bernstein said.\n“Now that Standard Chartered has actually shown evidence of successful derisking they should be able to convince the regulators they won’t need to issue a capital call,” Bernstein analyst Chirantan Barua said in a March 17 report, upgrading the stock to outperform from underperform. Winters’s appointment is also “a positive catalyst,” he said.\nThe bank now has 15 buy recommendations from analysts, 13 holds and nine sells, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nBoth Barclays and Bernstein do not rule out the firm raising new capital. A balance sheet review could result in $4.7 billion of new provisions, requiring 3.2 billion pounds ($4.7 billion) of additional equity to rebuild the bank’s capital buffer, Barclays said.\nBernstein’s Barua said he expects a $2.5 billion settlement with the U.S. Justice Department and New York’s Department for Financial Services for regulatory violations, including breaching U.S. sanctions laws and poor money laundering controls. If the settlement comes in higher, the bank may opt to raise $5 billion to shore up its capital, he said.\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal. LEARN MORE\n",

Photograph: Micha Theiner/City AM/Rex Features\nTuesday 22 December 2015 10.53 GMT\nLast modified on Thursday 11 August 2016 10.55 BST\nClose\nThis article is 12 months old\nITV’s share price has fallen by almost 3% in early trading as investors cooled on speculation about a possible takeover bid after NBC Universal-owner Comcast categorically denied it has held talks about a bid.\nInvestors excited about the prospect of an £11bn-plus takeover sent ITV’s shares up more than 4% at one point on Monday, following a weekend report that the broadcaster had held talks with Comcast.\nHowever, Comcast, which has run the rule over ITV as a potential takeover target in the past, released a strenuous denial that there was any deal in the offing.\n“We don’t comment on merger and acquisition rumours, but the speculation on ITV is just completely inaccurate,” said Comcast in a statement.\nITV, which tellingly did not issue a stock market statement about the supposed talks as it is required to do if there is an M&A move of material importance to investors, refused to comment.\nITV’s share price had fallen by 2.5% by 10.30am Tuesday as investors’ hopes of a big pay day from a takeover dissipated. By comparison the FTSE100 is so far slightly up.\n“ITV has a chief executive who talks to other media companies, not to look to flog ITV, but to see what they are up to, it’s standard practice,” said one City source. “[Adam] Crozier talking to rival media companies is misinterpreted sometimes. It’s his job.”\nDespite the Comcast speculation falling flat, ITV is seen as a likely candidate for a takeover by a foreign media owner in the medium term.\nThe broadcaster has spent more than £1bn to date building up its content business to decrease the traditional reliance on TV advertising as the main revenue stream.\nITV has invested in production companies, with over half of the division’s revenue now coming from outside the UK, making it an increasingly attractive proposition to buyers in the current “content is king” era.\nUS companies such as Discovery have been on a spending spree in recent years, buying assets including Skins and Midsomer Murders maker All3Media – jointly with Virgin Media owner Liberty Global which owns a 9.9% stake in ITV – Eurosport and the pan-European rights to the Olympics from 2022.\nLiberty Global is frequently cited as the most likely buyer of ITV, even though the company has described its stake building as “opportunistic” and not a precursor to a takeover, snapping up assets including Virgin Media.\nMTV-owner Viacom, which acquired Channel 5 from Richard Desmond last year, is also likely to be considered a prospective suitor for ITV.\n",

Financial terms were not disclosed.\n“It’s a sensible bit of tidying up,” said Wyn Ellis, an analyst at Numis Securities. Diageo can reinvest the proceeds from a sale elsewhere, Ellis said, noting that the company’s main priorities are returning its U.S. division to growth and reducing excess inventory held by wholesalers.\nGleneagles, a luxury resort and golf venue in the county of Perth, Scotland, was acquired by Diageo in 1984 and has been a target for divestment since 1998, according to The Times newspaper. In 2001, Diageo rejected an informal 90 million-pound ($141 million) offer for the property, it said.\nIn addition to last year’s Ryder Cup, the hotel is the venue for Diageo’s annual Johnnie Walker Championship golf tournament and has hosted political gatherings including the Bilderberg Conference and the G8 summit.\nThe hotel had operating profit of 2.6 million pounds and sales of 43.5 million pounds in the 12 months through June 2014.\n“Following the success of the Ryder Cup we feel this is an appropriate time to realize value,” Diageo Chief Executive Officer Ivan Menezes said in the statement.\nAnother possible candidate for divestment is the company’s wine business. Diageo said this year it has reviewed expressions of interest for the unit, which includes Blossom Hill and Yellow Tail.\n“A sale of the wine business is undoubtedly a possibility,” Numis’s Ellis said. “There’s a bit of tidying up left to do in the portfolio.”\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

REUTERS/Phil Noble\nBy Toni Clarke | WASHINGTON\nWASHINGTON AstraZeneca Plc's diabetes drug Onglyza and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co.'s rival product Nesina should carry information about the risk of heart failure, an advisory committee to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Tuesday.\nHeart failure is a condition in which the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. It can be caused by coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, diabetes or obesity, according to the Mayo Clinic.\nThe panel reviewed safety data on AstraZeneca's Onglyza and Takeda's Nesina. The drugs belong to a class known as DPP-4 inhibitors which also includes Merck & Co.'s Januvia. Januvia data from a trial known as TECOS will be presented at a scientific meeting in June.\nThe studies were requested by the FDA as part of a broader investigation into the safety of diabetes drugs. In December 2008, the agency issued guidance requiring companies to conduct studies to show the drugs did not increase cardiovascular risk.\nThe panel found that neither Onglyza nor Nesina increased the risk of cardiovascular death, stroke or heart attack. But data showed a statistically significant increase in the risk of heart failure with Onglyza and an increased risk with Nesina that did not reach statistical significance.\nSome panelists said that even though the heart failure risk seen with Nesina was modest, they suspect the risk will turn out to be a DPP-4 class effect and therefore worth including.\nThe panel did not recommend any restrictions on prescribing the drugs. AstraZeneca's U.S. shares rose 3.2 percent. Takeda's shares closed down 0.67 percent before the vote was announced. Merck's shares rose 1.8 percent.\n\"Given the absence of a serious safety issue for either Onglyza or Takeda's Nesina suggests that, barring an overtly negative signal in TECOS, growth of the DPP-4 class is likely to continue without a meaningful change in current prescribing trends,\" Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said in a research note.\nA preliminary FDA review of Onglyza published on Friday found an increase in the rate of death from all causes. Panel members said they were moderately concerned about the signal but said their concern was muted by the fact that the causes of death were varied and lacked any common theme.\nOnglyza, known also as saxagliptin, was approved in 2009. Nesina, or alogliptin, was approved in 2013. The FDA is not obliged to follow the advice of its advisory panels but typically does so.\n(Reporting by Toni Clarke; Editing by Will Dunham and Andrew Hay)\nNext In Health News\n",

  "articleText" : "Deals | Mon Mar 7, 2016 | 12:21pm EST\nLSE-Deutsche Boerse merger would signal end to exchange mega-deals\nleft\nright\nThe plaque of the Deutsche Boerse AG is pictured at the entrance of the Frankfurt stock exchange February 1, 2012. REUTERS/Alex Domanski\n1/2\nleft\nright\nThe German share prize index (DAX) board and the trading room of Frankfurt's stock exchange (Boerse Frankfurt) are photographed with a circular fisheye lens during afternoon trading session in Frankfurt, Germany, February 23, 2016. REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach\n2/2\nBy Huw Jones | LONDON\nLONDON If the merger between London Stock Exchange (LSE.L) and Deutsche Boerse (DB1Gn.DE) goes ahead, it could be the final mega-deal in the industry as further combinations of such scale are likely to hit antitrust buffers.\nThe two companies will seek to overcome the kind of regulatory concerns that scuppered Deutsche Boerse's attempt to merge with NYSE Euronext four years ago, a deal blocked because it would have created a near-monopoly on exchange-traded derivatives in Europe.\nThey could argue there is less overlap between certain business lines in any one region, namely Europe, say industry experts; for example while Deutsche Boerse has a big European derivatives trading operation, LSE is largely absent from that business.\nIf the deal is cleared it would create a \"Big Four\" of trading powerhouses that outstrip rivals in terms of market value and global reach - ICE (ICE.N) and CME (CME.O) in the United States, LSE-DB in Europe and Asia's Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (0388.HK).\nEach would have such large global operations in shares and derivatives trading, as well as indices and clearing, that any argument that business lines do not overlap could not prevail again, say industry officials and analysts.\n\"The very big players are already starting to be in danger of running into antitrust anywhere they go,\" said Patrick Young, a consultant to exchanges since the days of the first LSE-Deutsche Boerse tie up proposal back in 2000.\n\"We are coming to the point where the great exchanges merger game is coming to an end, the great powers have been defined.\"\nRegulators would be unlikely to allow the CME and ICE to merge, for instance, given a combined group would have a near-unassailable position in U.S. securities trading.\nIt is also unlikely that ICE would be allowed to buy a combined LSE-Deutsche Boerse group as this would create an effective monopoly of listed derivatives trading in Europe, say analysts.\nIt would also be hard to envisage the Chinese government allowing a foreign exchange take over Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing, they said.\nSMALLER PREY\nIf the LSE deal goes ahead, any big exchange looking to expand might instead have to look to hoovering up smaller peers.\n\"There is no one else left to buy up. It would be a range of mega exchanges buying a couple of selective, medium-sized exchanges,\" said Brian Taylor of BTA Consulting, which advises exchanges.\nIn Europe, smaller exchanges themselves such as Euronext (ENX.PA) and BME (BME.MC) would be forced to respond to the increased competition from a combined LSE-Deutsche Boerse to avoid being squeezed out, said Christian Voigt, senior regulatory adviser in London at Fidessa, which builds trading systems.\n\"All those medium-sized exchange groups ... will be forced to find an answer,\" he said. \"If you are stuck in such a position, you either have to start to grow or focus on a niche or specialty areas so that you can differentiate yourself.\"\nA source close to France-based Euronext, which was split from NYSE in 2014, said continuing with its strategy of maintaining its independence was no longer tenable, even if the LSE-Deutsche Boerse merger did not go ahead.\nEuronext and Spain's BME declined to comment.\nA London-Frankfurt merger could also pose problems for U.S. exchange Nasdaq (NDAQ.O). It would risk falling further and further behind a Big Four as it does not have the same global reach or a strong presence in derivatives trading and clearing - among the industry's highest-growth and margin businesses.\n\"I do think that (LSE-DB) would be pretty much the last of the mega mergers and poses an interesting question for Nasdaq. Do they need to do a deal, what is their focus?\" said Rich Daniels, senior analyst at TABB Group in New York.\nNasdaq declined to comment.\nUntil the slowdown in China's economy, Asia was seen as a promised land for western exchanges wanting to tap the region's growth and realize a dream of becoming truly global platforms.\nHowever national political barriers make foreign takeovers in Asia more difficult than elsewhere, BTA Consulting's Taylor said. In 2011 Australia banned an attempt by the Singapore Exchange to buy the Australian Stock Exchange to avoid a foreign country having too much sway in its financial center.\nAnalysts say Asian exchanges are more likely to snap up western peers rather than the other way round.\nThe Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing bought the London Metal Exchange in 2012, while Singapore's SGX exchange is among the suitors for London's Baltic Exchange.\n\"I don't think any country in Asia is ready to open up to foreign ownership,\" TABB Group's Daniels said. \"I don't think that politically it is time for Asia to be part of truly global consolidation.\"\nCLEARING & BREXIT\nThe proposed London-Frankfurt merger has not yet been formally put to regulators, but a major area of competition concern could be derivatives clearing, as LSE's LCH.Clearnet and Deutsche Boerse's Eurex Clearing are already the dominant players in Europe.\nIndustry experts said the British company could spin off the French half of its clearing house in a bid to assuage regulators.\nLSE and Deutsche Boerse declined to comment.\nA core reform from the global financial crisis is forcing large chunks of the world's $550 trillion derivatives market to pass through a clearing house to complete the trade even if one side of the transaction goes bust.\nThe lucrative service becomes mandatory for interest rate swaps in the European Union from June, and ICE and CME have both opened clearing houses in the region in the past five years.\n\"A DB-LSE tie-up would create a European clearing powerhouse that would pose more challenges for U.S.-based ICE and CME in building a European swaps and futures business,\" Benn Steil, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations think-tank in New York.\nBut other factors could also shape the industry's European landscape, such as if Britain, home to the region's biggest financial center, votes in June to back \"Brexit\" and leave the European Union.\nThe EU is putting in place reforms to create a capital markets union to help companies raise more money by issuing bonds and floating on stock exchanges, but exchanges would need to have a presence in the bloc to exploit this.\nWhile the LSE and Deutsche Boerse say their merger would be Brexit-proof, Britain leaving the EU could force other exchanges with European headquarters in London - such as BATS Chi-X, ICE and CME - to review where they should be based.\n(Additional reporting by Noor Hussain in Bangalore, John McCrank in New York, Alexandre Boksenbaum-Granier in Paris, Jonathan Gould in Frankfurt, and Jesus Aguado in Madrid; Editing by Pravin Char)\nNext In Deals\n",

(NYSE: KMI) today announced that the company has        finalized agreements with BP Products North America Inc. to acquire 15        refined products terminals and associated infrastructure in the United        States in a transaction valued at approximately $350 million. Kinder        Morgan and BP will form a joint venture limited liability company (JV)        terminal business to own 14 of the acquired assets, which Kinder Morgan        will operate and market on the JV’s behalf. One terminal will be owned        solely by KMI.\nThe terminals, with approximately 9.5 million barrels of storage, are        pipeline-connected to key refining and processing centers across the        United States and offer extensive truck, vessel, and barge access and        terminal service capabilities. In connection with the transaction, BP        will enter into commercial agreements securing long-term storage and        throughput capacity from the JV, which plans to market additional        capacity to third-party customers. The transaction is expected to close        in the first quarter of 2016.\n“We are excited to be partnering with BP on this joint venture,” said        John Schlosser, president of Kinder Morgan Terminals. “By combining BP’s        expertise in product trading and marketing with Kinder Morgan’s strength        in operations and terminal development, the JV is well suited for growth        opportunities in high-demand refined petroleum products markets. We        believe this arrangement benefits BP, Kinder Morgan and third-party        customers.”\nKinder Morgan will own a 75 percent interest in the JV, with BP owning        the balance. The terminals are located in the Midwest, Northeast,        Southeast and on the West Coast.\nKinder Morgan, Inc. (NYSE: KMI) is the largest energy infrastructure        company in North America. It owns an interest in or operates        approximately 84,000 miles of pipelines and 165 terminals. The company’s        pipelines transport natural gas, gasoline, crude oil, CO2 and        other products, and its terminals store petroleum products and        chemicals, and handle bulk materials like coal and petroleum coke.

  "articleText" : "StumbleUpon\nLONDON/BRUSSELS — Anheuser-Busch InBev raised its US$100 billion-plus bid for rival brewer SABMiller on Tuesday after a slide in the value of the pound following the Brexit vote made the offer less attractive for many investors, threatening to derail the deal.\nSABMiller said its chairman talked with his counterpart at AB InBev on Friday about the offer in the light of exchange rate volatility and market movements, although they did not discuss the new terms.\nThe world’s largest brewer will now offer 45 pounds a share for its nearest rival, an increase from the 44 pounds announced in October last year.\nIt also tweaked the terms of an alternative share-and-cash structure designed for SABMiller’s two largest shareholders, raising the cash element by 88 pence a share.\nRelated\nCanada will be smaller share of Molson Coors after US$12-billion deal for Miller brands\nThe offer values SABMiller at around 79 billion pounds (US$103.6 billion). In November, when the original bid was officially launched, it was worth around 70 billion pounds, or US$106 billion based on exchange rates at the time. That original bid had since dropped to about US$100 billion.\nAberdeen Asset Management, with a 1.17 per cent SABMiller stake according to Thomson Reuters data, said the revised offer was still unacceptable, although analysts suggested the deal was now likely to go through.\nSABMiller, which provisionally agreed the deal struck in October, said it had taken on Centerview Partners as a new financial adviser and would consult with Centerview and with shareholders before formally considering the revised offer.\nThe takeover is still awaiting regulatory approval in China. SABMiller shareholders would expect to vote on it after that.\nAB InBev (ABI), which has hedged to cover the pounds initially required, said the revised terms were final. Under British law, this means the price is set. AB InBev could only change it by dropping the offer and waiting six months to make another.\nLiberum analyst Alicia Forry said she believed the revised bid was likely to be successful by throwing a “small bone” to activist investors and shutting the door to further increases.\n“The main thing from ABI’s perspective is they don’t want this to drag and if they engaged (activists) it would,” she said.\nBernstein Research brewing analyst Trevor Stirling said SABMiller’s shares would probably drop to 41.50 pounds if AB InBev’s takeover bid failed, adding that for AB InBev, an extra US$2 billion was only a modest deterioration of a deal that made strategic sense by adding attractive African and Latin American markets.\nAt 1035 GMT, SABMiller shares were down 0.5 per cent at 44.20 pounds. AB InBev’s were up 0.9 per cent at 115.80 euros.\nThe changes come after a number of activist investors, such as Elliott Capital Advisors and TCI Fund Management, bought stakes in SABMiller and several shareholders voiced concerns at least week’s annual general meeting that the cash deal was less attractive for many investors than before and, in any case, below the share-and-cash alternative.\nThe latter, designed exclusively for Altria and Colombia’s Santo Domingo family who together own about 41 per cent of SABMiller, had been worth less than the all-cash option last year, but with the fall of sterling and a rise of AB InBev shares, has surpassed it since.\nFor a foreign dollar-based investor, the cash offer had dropped 12 per cent since the British referendum vote to leave the European Union on June 23. Meanwhile, AB InBev shares are more than 35 percent higher than October.\nAberdeen Asset Management said the revised offer undervalued the company and continued to favor SABMiller’s two major shareholders, Altria and Bevco.\nAB InBev said the share-and-cash offer value was now 51.14 pounds, so above the 45 pounds of pure cash, but the new shares offered would have to be held for at least five years.\n“I wouldn’t like to second guess what the activists were hoping for, but the increase is quite modest,” one SABMiller shareholder told Reuters.\n© Thomson Reuters 2016\n",

Those, however, are debates and tasks for others.\"\nPatrick Coughlin, a lawyer representing several pension fund plaintiffs, said: \"We're disappointed that the judge thought the exchanges deserved immunity as to complex order types. The way they were implemented disadvantaged our clients. We will review the opinion and determine whether to appeal.\"\nBarclays said it is pleased with the \"thorough and well-reasoned\" decision. The exchanges declined to comment.\nFurman said one plaintiff, Great Pacific Securities may amend its lawsuit against Barclays, calling it premature to say doing so would be futile. A lawyer for the Costa Mesa, California-based firm was not immediately available for comment.\nThe case is In re: Barclays Liquidity Cross and High Frequency Trading Litigation, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 14-md-02589.

  "articleText" : "By Caroline Humer\nThe antitrust division of the U.S. Department of Justice has subpoenaed Mylan N.V. for information relating to the pricing and marketing of its generic doxycycline antibiotic products, the drugmaker said on Friday.\nThe Department of Justice has also sought information on any communication with competitors about the anti-bacterial products, the company said in a regulatory filing, adding it would cooperate with the federal agency.\nThe nearly 40-year-old antibiotic is used to treat bacterial infections such as acne, pneumonia, Lyme disease, chlamydia and syphilis.\nCompetitors Endo International and Allergan Inc have also received similar subpoenas, according to regulatory filings made by them in November and August.\nU.S. drugmakers have been under increased pressure from the government, insurers and corporations over steep increases in the prices of generic drugs.\nMylan shares were up 34 cents, or 0.7 percent, at $51.40.\nIn a research note, Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Andrew Finkelstein said he believed Mylan was not the main beneficiary of doxycycline price hikes, and that competitors Allergan, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries and Hikma Pharmaceuticals had raised prices the most. The biggest price gains were in the first half of 2013, he said, and have since eased.\nAllergan, Sun Pharma and Hikma did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nEndo said in a November 2015 regulatory filing that it received a subpoena on Dec. 5, 2014 relating to communications with rivals regarding doxycycline and digoxin, a widely used generic drug used to treat heart failure.\nAllergan said in August it had received a subpoena from the antitrust division relating to generic products and communications with competitors. It did not disclose which drugs were involved.\nU.S. Senator Bernie Sanders and Democratic Representative Elijah Cummings opened an investigation last fall into 14 drug companies, including Mylan and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, over price increases of generic drugs.\nIn February, Sanders and Cummings asked the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' enforcement arm to investigate generic drug price increases. As an example, they cited doxycycline hyclate 100 milligram capsules, the price of which had more than doubled in the year through June 2014.\nThere are many forms of doxycyline made by more than a dozen companies, according to the U.S. Food & Drug Administration's database.\nThe discussion over drug pricing has intensified and become part of Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's campaign after Turing Pharmaceuticals raised the price of a generic medication by 5000 percent in one day.\n(Reporting by Caroline Humer in New York and Natalie Grover in Bengaluru; Editing by Bernadette Baum)\nNext In Internal Reuters News Room Exclusives And Wins MOL\n",

  "articleText" : "No pressure to develop new supply projects: Woodside\nLNG market will re-emerge as excess supply absorbed: Chevron\nShare on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp\nThe over-supplied LNG market is in hiatus as energy giants from Chevron Corp. to Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Woodside Petroleum Corp. await a surge of demand from countries seeking access to energy.\nLiquefied natural gas producers are in “pause mode” as low prices have stalled development of new projects, Woodside Chief Executive Officer Peter Coleman said today at the LNG18 conference in Perth. That respite means that coming years demand will exceed supply, causing prices to rise back to higher levels, Shell CEO Ben Van Beurden said.\nThe price cycle underscores difficulties in timing the construction of multi-billion dollar projects that take years to come online. Companies have to focus on long-term natural gas demand which is expected to grow by 35 percent over the next 20 years, Chevron CEO John Watson said.\n“There is LNG that’s coming on line and it’s clear that there is some surplus. Customers are doing what you would expect them to do, they are going to take advantage of that in the short term,” Watson said. “Once you see that surplus absorbed, you will see that market re-emerge.”\nNo Pressure\nSpot prices for LNG in Singapore fell below $4 per million British thermal units on Monday, according to Singapore Exchange Ltd. That’s the lowest level since the exchange began tracking it in September 2014. It’s plunged from $14 in October 2014.\nAs oil prices slid about 60 percent since mid-2014, more than $400 billion of proposed energy projects have been delayed until 2017 and beyond, according to consulting firm Wood Mackenzie Ltd. Woodside and partners Shell and BP Plc in March scrapped plans to develop the $40 billion Browse liquefied natural gas project in Australia after the plunge in energy prices.\n“We are not under the pressure of having to develop at the moment,” Coleman said. “Industry is in this hiatus, in this pause mode where there is really no market to sell into, so it gives us a chance to step back and say what is the best way to move.”\nDemand Optimism\nThe market could see a deficit of 75 million metric tons of LNG per year by 2025, which would require $250 billion in investment through 2020, Sanford C. Bernstein estimated in November. The market is well-supplied to 2018 and possibly to the end of the decade, it said. Annual demand in Asia-Pacific may gain 36 percent to 245 million tons by 2025, Western Australia’s Premier Colin Barnett said today.\n“The industry may be cyclical and sometimes volatile, but the long term growth trend is undeniable,” Barnett said. Woodside may decide to develop Browse within the next three-to-five years, he said later to reporters. “I am very optimistic about the demand for gas, so I have no doubt Browse will go ahead.”\nDemand is also coming from new markets including Thailand, Pakistan and Poland, Shell said. Australia may increase LNG sales to Europe as the continent struggles with security of supply via pipelines, Barnett said.\nNew Customers\nOil and LNG prices have historically been linked because traditional long-term contracts priced the gas in relation to crude. Brent oil has surged more than 50 percent since hitting a 12-year low in January amid the worst energy crash in a generation. The global benchmark on Tuesday rose as much as 2.7 percent to $44 a barrel.\nMeanwhile, LNG has fallen 28 percent in the same period. Shell expects most LNG to continue on the long-term model based on a mixture of oil and natural gas indices. Short-term prices will be volatile, Van Beurden said.\n“Shorter term LNG will go through different pricing environments,” he said. “At the moment there is a bit more depth, a bit more room in the market, so short-term prices are probably a little bit discounted. When we see that shortness disappear, and the market goes tight again, it will price above the long-term.”\nLow prices represent an opportunity to hook new customers on the product, said Hamad Mubarak Al Muhannadi, chief executive officer for RasGas Co. of Qatar, the world’s biggest LNG-producing country. Lower oil prices and increased LNG production has already eliminated regional price differences that meant Asian buyers traditionally payed more than those in Europe or the Americas, he said.\n“For us, creating new customers and new markets is the issue,” Al Muhannadi said. “This is definitely going to create more demand.\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

AFP/Getty Images\nThe Dutch lender that forced Royal Bank of Scotland into the arms of the UK taxpayer in 2008 is set for a return to the stock market.\nSeven years after ABN Amro was nationalised at the height of the financial crisis, the Dutch government has fired the starting gun on a flotation to start recouping the €22bn (£116bn) it spent rescuing the bank. \nRBS, then led by Fred Goodwin, fought off Barclays to win control of ABN with a £49bn bid in 2007, in combination with the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis and Spain’s Santander. The takeover had a disastrous impact on the balance sheet of RBS just as the financial crisis entered its most serious phase, resulting in a huge bailout for the lender. Meanwhile the Dutch government was forced to nationalise Fortis and its ABN assets. \nRBS posted a £24bn loss, the biggest in UK corporate history, of which £16bn was a goodwill loss on the ABN deal. \nThe Dutch government has said it aims to sell as much as 30 per cent of ABN, potentially by the end of the year, and has signalled that it is worth around €15bn. The company is now a fraction of its former size after a reorganisation in 2010 that focused the business on its home market. Chief executive Gerrit Zalm, a former Dutch finance minister, said the move “marks an important step towards our new future”. \nRead more\n",

Make your car more fuel-efficient. You can do this by keeping your tyres inflated, taking the roof rack off, emptying your car of clutter and turning off your air con when driving at lower speeds.\n2. Drive more efficiently. Some ways to do this, include:\n– Accelerate gradually without over-revving\n– Always drive on the highest possible gear\n– If you can, allow your car to slow down naturally as your brake is a money burner\n– Re-starting your car is expensive, if you can keep moving\n3. Find the cheapest fuel prices. Use PetrolPrices.com. All you need to do is enter in your postcode and tell it how far you want to travel (up to 20 miles).\nHoward Cox, FairFuel UK co-founder told the Sun this morning: “Asda as usual is the first to cut pump prices significantly.\n“This welcome kick-start to fairer pump prices must make other retailers follow, albeit it has been a long time coming with wholesalers deliberately not passing at least 4p to millions of hard-working drivers in October.”\nRAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “While this level of cut is clearly good news it has come far too late as the wholesale price of fuel has been falling since the end of October when the oil price began to fall again.\n“Retailers should have reduced their prices then rather than making one bigger headline-grabbing cut now. The RAC called for a cut last week so it’s a case of better late than never.\n“The first two weeks of November unfortunately prove that the ‘rocket and feather’ does exist. This is a great shame as retailers previously had a good record of lowering their prices in response to wholesale cost savings.”\nWe pay for your stories!

  "articleText" : "Shell Targets Gains From Brazil to LNG With Takeover of BG Group\nDylan Griffiths\nShare on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp\nRoyal Dutch Shell Plc’s 47 billion-pound ($70 billion) acquisition of BG Group Plc, the oil and gas industry’s biggest deal in at least a decade, combines the two companies’ assets from Brazil to Australia and the North Sea.\nShell is targeting $2.5 billion of pretax “synergies” a year across the globe from the deal , including staff cuts. Here’s a look at the worldwide effects:\nBrazil:\nThe purchase will increase Shell’s access to deepwater fields off Brazil and give the merged entity more heft in its relations with local partner Petroleo Brasileiro SA. BG’s portfolio will make Shell the leading foreign oil company in Brazil, according to Jefferies analysts led by Jason Gammel. BG’s production is set to increase to 557,000 barrels a day by 2020 from 144,000 in 2015, Jefferies said.\nBG has non-operating stakes in five blocks in the pre-salt area, an offshore region where Petrobras made the world’s largest discovery in at least three decades from 2006 to 2007. Shell also has partnerships with Petrobras, including the giant offshore Libra project in which it holds a 20 percent stake.\nAustralia:\nBG gives Shell an outlet for its natural gas reserves in Australia ’s Queensland state. Shell and its partner PetroChina Co. have been looking at alternatives for their Arrow gas project after shelving plans to build an export terminal this year due to cost blowouts and slumping energy prices. BG’s $20 billion Queensland Curtis LNG development may provide a solution for the “stranded” Arrow assets, according to Neil Beveridge, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in Hong Kong.\nNorth Sea:\nShell and BG have complementary asset portfolios in the North Sea , making job cuts “possible,” according to William Hares, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst. About 10,000 North Sea employees and contractors have lost their jobs since the price of oil began to fall last year. Shell, which employs about 2,400 across the North Sea, said March 26 that about 250 positions would go in Aberdeen , the Scottish city at the center of the U.K. oil and gas industry.\nAfrica:\nShell has downscaled operations in South Africa, where it has applied for exploration licenses to explore the semi-desert Karoo region that may hold as much as 390 trillion cubic feet of shale gas. Local exploration resources have been adjusted as the company also awaits clarity on natural resource legislation, Shell said March 16.\nShell is backing plans for an LNG plant in Tanzania, according to Ahmed Salim, a Dubai-based analyst at Teneo Intelligence. BG has a 60 percent interest in three blocks off Tanzania and is involved with plans to develop an LNG plant.\nCanada:\nThe proposal by Shell and its Asian partners for an LNG export terminal on Canada’s Pacific Coast is “one of the best, well-planned” projects, according to TransCanada Corp. Chief Executive Officer Russ Girling. The Shell project is one of more than a dozen proposals to export chilled gas by tanker from Canada’s Pacific to Asia. BG is among proponents that have delayed final decisions on Canadian projects as slumping energy prices trim cash for producers.\nShell is set to make a final decision on the Kitimat LNG terminal by mid-2016, said Girling, whose TransCanada would build a gas pipeline to serve the facility.\nU.S.:\nUntil now, Shell has had a limited stake in the emergence of the U.S. as an exporter of natural gas, with its only involvement being a 49 percent holding in a project to transform the Elba Island LNG terminal near Savannah, Georgia, into an export terminal. BG is producing gas in the Haynesville shale in Texas and in the Marcellus shale in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The company has plans to export LNG from the U.S. from the Lake Charles facility in Louisiana.\nLNG:\nThe combined entity will be the largest producer of LNG among international oil companies, Shell Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden said on Wednesday. It would have delivered 45 million metric tons of LNG in 2014, including 11 million tons from BG, Shell said. Shell’s equity LNG capacity, at projects from Australia to Russia to Nigeria, was 25.6 million tons a year at the end of 2014, the CEO said. That’s set to rise 80 percent by 2018, including new production and BG’s assets. BG’s trading portfolio will help Shell develop its business buying and selling the fuel, said Malcolm Johnson, a faculty member of The Oxford Princeton Programme who spent more than 30 years with Shell in gas and LNG.\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

In an effort to win back customers lost to discounters, Lewis is changing the way the grocer works with suppliers, adding staff at stores and cutting prices. Photographer: Simon Dawson/Bloomberg\nShare on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp\nTesco Plc was cut to below investment grade at Moody’s Investors Service, dealing a blow to Chief Executive Officer Dave Lewis on the day he unveiled efforts to stabilize Britain’s biggest retailer.\nMeasures announced by Lewis “will take time to implement and the company’s financial profile is likely to remain leveraged beyond what we consider to be commensurate with an investment-grade profile,” Sven Reinke, a Moody’s analyst, said in a statement. The senior long-term rating was cut to Ba1 from Baa3, the last investment-grade level.\nThe move will probably add to the grocer’s borrowing costs and increase pressure on Lewis to raise capital quickly, either by divesting businesses or selling new shares. The CEO said today that there was no need for a fire sale of assets, describing Tesco’s funding and liquidity as “really robust” after the company secured a 5 billion-pound ($7.5 billion) loan last year.\nIn an effort to win back customers lost to discounters, Lewis is changing the way the grocer works with suppliers, adding staff at stores and cutting prices. Competition among grocers in the country could lead to a “permanent reduction in average operating margins in the industry” from 3 percent to 4 percent, and is a primary reason for today’s move, Moody’s said.\nTurnaround Efforts\nThe reduction comes after Tesco Chief Financial Officer Alan Stewart met with credit-rating providers yesterday in an effort to persuade them to keep their investment-grade ratings.\n“If there is a downgrade it would be with the intention that we intend to operate as an investment-grade company,” Stewart told reporters after Tesco reported an improvement in sales over the Christmas period. He also unveiled measures to bolster the grocer’s performance including the closure of stores and the company’s head office. “We’ll continue the dialog.”\nTesco has had one of its toughest years, issuing three profit warnings since June as the loss of shoppers to discounters Aldi and Lidl was compounded by the discovery of an accounting black hole.\nThe CEO is reviewing all aspects of the business, with analysts speculating it may divest operations in countries such as Thailand or South Korea. Tesco today said that it appointed Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to “explore strategic options” for the Dunnhumby data-analytics unit that include a sale and an initial public offering.\nEven after a “successful execution of the intended asset sales, the company’s leverage will likely remain at levels more consistent with a Ba1 rating over the intermediate term,” Moody’s said.\n",

  "articleText" : "Det norske and BP join forces to grow Norway’s leading independent oil and gas producer\nDet norske and BP join forces to grow Norway’s leading independent oil and gas producer\nDate: 10 June 2016\nDeal creates strategic platform for long-term growth in Norway, combining Det norske’s efficient operating model with BP’s experience and technical expertise\nBP and Det norske oljeselskap today announced the creation of Aker BP ASA, an independent oil and gas company combining the assets and expertise from both companies’ Norwegian exploration and production operations to form the largest Norwegian independent oil and gas producer.\nBP group chief executive Bob Dudley commented: “BP and Aker have matured a close collaboration through decades, and we are pleased to take advantage of the industrial expertise of both companies to create a large independent E&P company. The Norwegian Continental Shelf represents a significant opportunity going forward and we are looking forward to working together with Aker to unlock the long term value of the company through growth and efficient operations. This innovative deal demonstrates how we can adapt our business model with strong and talented partners to remain competitive and grow where we see long-term benefit for our shareholders.”\nUnder the terms of the proposed transaction, the BP Norge and Det norske businesses will combine and be renamed Aker BP ASA. Aker BP will be independently operated and listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. Aker BP will be jointly owned by current Det norske shareholder Aker (40%), other Det norske shareholders (30%) and BP (30%). BP will also receive a cash payment of $140 million plus positive working capital adjustments as part of the transaction.\nØyvind Eriksen, chairman of the board of directors in Det norske commented: “Aker BP will leverage on Det norske’s efficient operations, BP’s international capabilities and Aker’s 175 years of industrial experience. Together, we are establishing a strong platform for creating value for our shareholders through our unique industrial capabilities, a world-class asset base, and financial robustness.”\nThe completion of the transaction, which is expected by the end of 2016, is subject to customary closing conditions, regulatory review and approval by Det norske shareholders. All of BP Norge’s roughly 850 employees will transfer to the combined organization upon completion of the deal.\nIn addition to the attractive combination of the two companies’ Norwegian asset portfolios, Aker BP will benefit from the combined strength of Det norske’s efficient, streamlined operating model and BP’s long experience in Norwegian offshore operations, asset knowledge, technical skills and international experience. The companies believe this new Norwegian super-independent could organically grow production to more than 250,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by the early 2020s.\nAbout Det norske\nHeadquartered in Trondheim, Det norske oljeselskap ASA is a rapidly growing independent exploration and production company with exploration, development and production activities on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. Det norske merged with Aker Exploration in 2009 and acquired Marathon Oil Norway in 2014. It employs about 550 people.\nDet norske is the operator of producing fields Alvheim, Volund, Vilje and Jette. The company is also the operator of the large Ivar Aasen development. The company is also a partner in the Johan Sverdrup field, one of the largest on the Norwegian continental shelf.

Aker owns 49.9% of Det norske (oil and gas producer) along with significant ownership stakes in Aker Solutions (oilfield services) and Kvaerner (oilfield construction) amongst other interests.

REUTERS/Toby Melville\nBy James Davey | LONDON\nLONDON Sales at Britain's biggest retailer Tesco (TSCO.L) edged higher over the last three months, industry data showed on Wednesday, adding to signs of a tentative recovery in the supermarket's fortunes under its new boss.\nMarket share figures from researchers Kantar Worldpanel also showed discounter Aldi overtaking upmarket chain Waitrose to become Britain's sixth-largest supermarket by sales.\nThe rise of Aldi and fellow discounter Lidl has been a major thorn in Tesco's side in recent years.\nSince joining in September, new Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis has been fighting back by cutting prices, increasing product availability, cutting queues and improving stores.\nKantar Worldpanel said Tesco's sales rose 0.3 percent in the 12 weeks to March 29.\nThat increase, which followed data last month showing Tesco's strongest sales performance in 18 months, helped the supermarket to almost halt its market share decline. Its share was down only two tenths of a percentage point to 28.4 percent compared with last year.\nShares in Tesco are down 11 percent year-on-year, but are up a third so far this year on recovery hopes. The stock was down 1.3 pence to 250 pence at 1003 GMT, valuing the business at 20.5 billion pounds ($30.6 billion).\nLewis is also cutting costs and selling assets to mend Tesco's finances and fight back from years of declining market share, debt-rating downgrades and an accounting scandal.\nThe firm reports 2014-15 results on April 22 when it is expected to post a third straight fall in annual profit.\nOf Tesco's major rivals, Sainsbury's (SBRY.L) saw a sales increase of 0.2 percent in the three-month period, its first growth since August 2014.\nHowever, Asda and Morrisons (MRW.L) recorded sales declines of 1.1 percent and 0.7 percent respectively.\nAsda, the British arm of U.S. group Wal-Mart (WMT.N), in particular appears to have been affected by Tesco's improvement.\nAldi and Lidl's sales rose 16.8 percent and 12.1 percent respectively, taking their market shares to 5.3 percent and 3.7 percent.\nAldi's growth has been fuelled by over half a million new shoppers choosing to visit this year and average basket sizes increasing by 7 percent, Kantar said, though it added that sales growth for the discounters had slowed in recent months.\nAldi has an expansion plan which will see it double in size, reaching 1,000 stores by 2022.\nBritain's overall grocery market grew 1.0 percent over the period, Kantar said. Grocery inflation was down 2.0 percent, reflecting the impact of Aldi and Lidl and the market’s competitive response, as well as deflation in some major categories including vegetables, milk, eggs and bread.\n(Editing by Keith Weir and Mark Potter)\nNext In Business News\n",

  "articleText" : "Global Energy News | Tue Jan 20, 2015 | 5:50pm EST\nBP asks for lower fine in penalty phase of Gulf spill trial\nA logo on a British Petroleum petrol station is seen in London in this file photo taken on April 30, 2010. REUTERS/Toby Melville\nBy Jonathan Kaminsky | NEW ORLEANS\nNEW ORLEANS BP Plc, citing low oil prices, tried to whittle away at $13.7 billion in potential fines under the Clean Water Act on Tuesday as the penalty phase started in its trial over the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill.\nBP said its fine should be modest as it took extensive steps to mitigate the worst offshore disaster in U.S. history and that the defendant named in the case, BP's exploration and production unit, known as BPXP, cannot afford a big penalty.\n\"There has been no collapse of the ecosystem,\" BP lawyer Mike Brock said in opening statements, contending that the Gulf has been more resilient than thought. Environmental groups say it could take decades for the Gulf to recover.\nBrock said the penalties should take into account BPXP's ability to pay, and not be tied to the balance sheet of its parent company.\nHe said a 60 percent drop in oil prices since June has slashed BPXP's value to about $5.1 billion, down from $16 billion just months ago.\nThe government knows that \"BPXP cannot afford a penalty in the range that they are asking for, and so that's why they are saying look to the parent,\" Brock said.\nSteve O'Rourke, the government's lawyer, said BPXP and BP are effectively the same company. He urged a fine of $11.7 to $13.7 billion.\n\"BP's litigation position in this phase suggests that it still doesn't understand the gravity of what's happened here, they continue to focus on their own hardships rather than the hardships of the environment and the people,\" O'Rourke said.\nU.S. District Court Judge Carl Barbier asked during Brock's opening statements whether the parties believed the penalties could be paid over a period of years given the current state of BPXP's finances.\nBrock said he was not sure, while O'Rourke said such precedent exists.\nClean Water Act rules say when assigning penalties the court must look at BP’s ability to pay, steps it took to clean up the spill, and its history of past violations.\nIn 2012, one person was killed and two were injured at a BP natural gas plant in Colorado. The Macondo blowout in 2010 killed 11 men on Transocean Ltd's Deepwater Horizon drilling rig.\nIn 2005, 15 died in an explosion at BP's Texas City refinery, which the company later sold. In 2006, oil spilled from a BP-operated pipeline in Alaska. And in 2005, BP's Thunder Horse oil and gas platform in the Gulf of Mexico nearly sank because of a design flaw, postponing its startup by three years.\nThe Clean Water Act penalties would come on top of more than $42 billion the oil major has set aside for cleanup, compensation and fines. About 810,000 barrels were collected during cleanup.\nSeveral billion dollars in potential fines were avoided on Thursday when Barbier put the size of the spill at 3.19 million barrels. That was well below the government's estimate of 4.09 million barrels, which could have led to $17.6 billion in fines.\nThe first two phases of the trial, over the degree of negligence and the spill's size, have concluded. The penalty phase is expected to last three weeks.\nUnder a \"gross negligence\" ruling Barbier issued in September, BP could be fined a statutory limit of $4,300 for each barrel spilled, though he has authority to set lower penalties.\nBP has also filed motions saying the maximum fine per barrel is in fact just $3,000 because Congress never passed laws to adjust it for inflation.\nA simple \"negligence\" ruling, which BP sought, caps the maximum fine at $1,100 per barrel.\n(Writing by Terry Wade; Editing by Lisa Shumaker, Anna Driver and Tom Brown)\nNext In Global Energy News\nArgentina unemployment drops in breath of fresh air for government\nBUENOS AIRES Argentina's unemployment rate dropped to 8.5 percent in the third quarter of the year, the government's Indec statistics agency said in a report on Friday, a bright spot in a slew of poor economic data for the recession-stricken country.\n",

  "articleText" : "Tesco Said to Discuss Central and Eastern European Unit Sale\nSam Chambers and Ruth David\nSeptember 7, 2015 — 8:47 AM EDT\nUpdated on\nShare on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp\nTesco Plc, which announced the sale of its South Korean business Monday, is also considering divesting its central and eastern European operations to further reduce debt, according to three people familiar with the matter.\nWhile the company is discussing options with advisers, no final decision has been made, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the discussions are private. The business, valued by Sanford C. Bernstein at 1.9 billion pounds ($2.9 billion), includes over 1,110 stores that generate 6.45 billion pounds of revenue. Shares of Tesco’s Turkish unit rose as much as 9.3 percent.\nTesco Chief Executive Officer Dave Lewis has pledged to shore up the company’s finances and regain an investment-grade credit rating. The agreement to offload its South Korean business knocks 4.23 billion pounds off total borrowings. Yet the figure represents just under one-fifth of the retailer’s indebtedness. A Tesco spokesman declined to comment.\nAlongside the Korea sale, Tesco is exploring options for its Dunnhumby data-analytics unit. A sale of its Thai business, which includes more than 1,700 stores, could fetch in excess of 4 billion pounds, estimates John Kershaw, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas.\nCompared with its operations in Asia, Tesco’s stores in central and eastern Europe -- spanning Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Turkey -- have less to offer potential acquirers, according to analysts. Sales have fallen for three straight years amid intense competition from low-cost retailers like Germany’s Aldi.\n“In its central and eastern European markets, economic conditions have been tough,” Bryan Roberts, an analyst with Kantar Retail, said by phone. “Tesco has been getting an absolute kicking from the discounters.”\n20 Years\nWhile the unit’s faltering performance means Lewis “would love” to sell, there are no “natural acquirers,” said Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne, who values the businesses at 1.9 billion pounds. The company generates 60 million pounds in annual earnings before interest and taxes in the region, according to estimates from UBS AG analyst Andrew Gwynn.\nTesco’s presence in central Europe dates back 20 years. The company entered Hungary in 1995 and has grown to become the country’s third-largest employer. In 1996, the company opened stores in Poland, now its largest market in the region, as well as in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Turkish operations began in 2003.\nShares in Tesco Kipa, the company’s Turkish unit, rose 6.5 percent to 2.3 liras at 4:05 p.m. in Istanbul.\nTesco merged the management teams of its central and eastern European businesses in March, a move that Kantar Retail said could be a precursor to an eventual sale.\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Aviva said its turnaround is ongoing as it reported a fall in net profit for 2014 due to the 2013 sale of its US life and related internal asset management businesses, but operating profit excluding this rose as increases in its life business, general insurance and health helped to offset a fall in fund management operating profit. In what could be its last annual earnings statement in its current form with the proposed GBP5.6 billion acquisition of life insurance rival Friends Life Group expected to complete in the second quarter of 2015, Aviva said its net profit fell to GBP1.74 billion in 2014, compared with GBP2.15 billion in 2013. Friends Life, meanwhile, swung to a net loss of GBP138 million in 2014, compared with a net profit of GBP235 million in 2013.\nITV, up 2.4%. Goldman Sachs has added the broadcaster to its Conviction Buy List. On Wednesday the company proposed a GBP250 million special dividend at 6.25 pence per share and raised its total ordinary dividend for 2014, as it posted results ahead of expectations and higher than in 2013.\nSchroders, up 2.3%. The asset manager raised its dividend as it reported growth in pretax profit, net inflows from clients and assets under management in 2014. The company said it made a GBP517.1 million pretax profit in 2014, compared with GBP447.5 million in the prior year, as net revenue rose by GBP123.6 million to GBP1.53 billion and operating expenses increased by GBP55.3 million to GBP1.03 billion.\nRolls Royce Holdings, up 2.0%. The aerospace group said its Industria de Turbo Propulsores SA joint venture will supply the British engine maker with turbines for future civil large engines in addition to its existing range of products, under a revised shareholder agreement with joint venture partner Sener Grupo de Ingenieria SA.\n-------\nFTSE 100 LOSERS\n-------\nHSBC Holdings, down 2.3%. The Bank of England’s chief banking supervisor has told British lawamakers that he is holding HSBC Holdings' top executives' \"feet to the fire\" to ensure they simplify the group and improve its risk controls after a tax evasion scandal at its Swiss private bank, the Financial Times reports Thursday.\nRio Tinto, down 1.9%, and RSA Insurance Group, down 1.6%. The companies have gone ex-dividend, meaning new buyers no longer qualify for the latest dividend payouts.\nInternational Consolidated Airlines Group, down 1.1%. Ireland's government expects International Consolidated Airlines Group to make a further offer to convince it to sell its 25% stake in Aer Lingus, Ireland's Deputy Prime Minister Joan Burton said Thursday according to the BBC.\nAggreko, down 0.9%. The temporary power company reported a fall in profit in 2014, mainly due to large hit from the strength of sterling on its translated overseas earnings, while revenue was broadly flat as challenging trading in Asia Pacific offset strong growth in the Americas and a good performance in Europe, Middle East and Africa.\n-------\nFTSE 250 WINNERS\n-------\nBetfair Group, up 16%. The online betting firm revised up its full-year earnings expectations following a strong third quarter, its fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth as it continues to attract new customers. It said it expects a strong finish to the year with record levels of political betting in the run up to the UK general election in May.\nSpirax-Sarco Engineering, up 8.9%. The company added its name to the list of UK engineering businesses which saw results held back by the strength of sterling in 2014, with the company reporting a small fall in pretax profit, though the company sweetened the pill with a GBP91 million return of capital. Despite the fall in pretax profit, the company said it will increase its final dividend payment to 45 pence per share, from 41 pence last year, meaning its total dividend for the year will be 64.5 pence, up 9% on the 59 pence per share paid a year earlier.\nHunting, up 6.9%. The oil services company said it has increased its final dividend by 5% despite its pretax profit falling in 2014 due to impairment charges. The energy services company reported revenue of USD1.38 billion, a significant rise from GBP1.29 billion reported a year earlier. The rise came from its well completion and well intervention units, partially offset by a fall in revenue from its well construction unit.\n-------\nFTSE 250 LOSERS\n-------\nCobham, down 3.0%. The aerospace and defence manufacturer reported a big fall in pretax profit for 2014 despite higher revenue, as the company's results were held back by restructuring and acquisition costs. Cobham said its pretax profit for the year was GBP24 million, sharply down from the GBP127 million it posted a year earlier due to costs related to the acquisition of US communications equipment maker Aeroflex and restructuring measures.\nDomino Printing Sciences, down 1.9%, and Kennedy Wilson Europe Real Estate, down 1.7%. The companies have gone ex-dividend.\n-------\nAIM ALL-SHARE WINNERS\n-------\nCAP-XX, up 23%. The maker of thin-form supercapacitors that extend the performance of batteries reported a narrowed loss for the first half of its financial year, and said it has raised an estimated GBP1.1 million in a share placing and subscription, money it will use to reduce production costs and invest in product development. The company said it had raised gross proceeds of GBP1.2 million, or an estimated GBP1.1 million net of expenses, through a placing and subscription of 120 million shares at 1 pence each. The fundraising needs to be approved by shareholders.\nAurasian Minerals, up 21%. The company said Chairman Tony Shearer has stepped down and has been replaced by Bruce Kay.\nNorthern Petroleum, up 11%. The company said it has sold an 80% stake in the company's Cascina Alberto permit in Italy to a subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell. Under the terms of the deal, Shell will become the operator of the permit and pay Northern Petroleum a total of USD850,000 for the 80% stake. Northern Petroleum will retain the remaining 20% stake in the permit.\nBotswana Diamonds, up 9.2%. The company said it has recommenced exploration work in Orapa, Botswana with its joint venture partner Alrosa. A joint team from both companies have restarted exploration work on three blocks with the aim of finding major new kimberlites, an igneous rock that is associated with containing diamonds.\n-------\nAIM ALL-SHARE LOSERS\n-------\nWilliam Sinclair Holdings, off 22%. The maker of horticulture brands like J Arthur Bower as well as industrial lightweight aggregates said its Chief Executive was leaving and it was set to report annual results that will be materially worse than the previous year.

  "articleURL" : "http://www.fda.gov/newsevents/newsroom/pressannouncements/ucm432543.htm",
  "articleText" : "Español\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration today expanded the approved uses of Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine dimesylate) to treat binge-eating disorder in adults. The drug is the first FDA-approved medication to treat this condition.\nIn binge-eating disorder, patients have recurrent episodes of compulsive overeating during which they consume larger amounts of food than normal and experience the sense that they lack control. Patients with this condition eat when they are not hungry and often eat to the point of being uncomfortably full. Patients may feel ashamed and embarrassed by how much they are eating, which can result in social isolation. Binge-eating disorder may lead to weight gain and to health problems related to obesity.\n“Binge eating can cause serious health problems and difficulties with work, home, and social life,” said Mitchell Mathis, M.D., director of the Division of Psychiatry Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “The approval of Vyvanse provides physicians and patients with an effective option to help curb episodes of binge eating.”\nVyvanse was reviewed under the FDA’s priority review program, which provides for an expedited review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious disease or condition and may provide a significant improvement over available therapy.\nThe efficacy of Vyvanse in treating binge-eating disorder was shown in two clinical studies that included 724 adults with moderate-to-severe binge-eating disorder. In the studies, participants taking Vyvanse experienced a decrease in the number of binge eating days per week and had fewer obsessive-compulsive binge eating behaviors compared to those on the inactive pill (placebo).\nVyvanse is dispensed with a Medication Guide for patients, which provides important information about the medication’s use and risks. The most serious risks include psychiatric problems and heart complications, including sudden death in people who have heart problems or heart defects, and stroke and heart attack in adults. Central nervous system stimulants, like Vyvanse, may cause psychotic or manic symptoms, such as hallucinations, delusional thinking, or mania, even in individuals without a prior history of psychotic illness.\nThe most common side effects reported by people taking Vyvanse in the clinical trials included dry mouth, sleeplessness (insomnia), increased heart rate, jittery feelings, constipation, and anxiety.\nVyvanse is not approved for, or recommended for, weight loss. Its efficacy for weight loss has not been studied.\nVyvanse was approved in 2007 as a once-daily medication to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in patients ages 6 and older. Vyvanse is a Schedule II controlled substance because it has high potential for abuse, with use potentially leading to dependence.\nVyvanse is marketed by Shire U.S., Inc., based in Wayne, Pennsylvania.  \nThe FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation's food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.\n###\n",

No approach has been received by eOne,” it said in a statement this morning.\nArticles reported that ITV had engaged in preliminary talks about a potential deal but no decision had been made.\nEntertainment One, the majority was tipped as a takeover target after it was forced to raise new debt to refinance, a move that sloughed 50% off its share price.\nITV has been snuffling around for new content for several months now to boost its portfolio and cut its reliance on cyclical advertising revenues.\n“We believe that this deal would make sense for ITV, ITV has the financial capability to do this deal and acquiring EOne's business would significantly build ITV's content reach,” said analysts at Liberum.\nEntertainment One’s current market capitalisation is around £680m and the adjusted net debt at as of first half of 2015 was £250m. So assuming ITV paid a 20% premium on the share price, it would be paying around £1.06bn, estimates the broker.\n“This is more than manageable for ITV,” it said.\nThe acquisition would significantly build on ITV’s content reach, but in a different direction that its previously acquire content assets. Entertainment One’s business model helps to finance content and in return, retains the distribution rights, a similar model to subscription platforms such as Netflix and Amazon video.\n“One possible option ITV may pursue – if it did buy EOne – would be to divest of the films business, which is more volatile and which would seem to fit in less with its content strategy,” theorised Liberum.\nShares in Entertainment One shot up 18% on the news, but appear to be levelling after the statement.\nShare\n",

  "articleText" : "Wed Apr 13, 2016 | 11:20am EDT\nDespite sales growth, UK's Tesco cautions recovery to be bumpy\nBy James Davey and Paul Sandle | LONDON\nLONDON Tesco (TSCO.L), Britain's biggest retailer, said on Wednesday its recovery was gaining pace but warned a supermarket price war meant profit growth would be hard to deliver this year.\nThe company, hammered by an accounting scandal and the rise of German discount chains, reported a first rise in underlying annual profit growth in four years and its first quarter of underlying UK sales growth for over three years. But it said there was much more work to do.\n\"We feel like we stabilized the business. We don't feel that we're in the crisis that, being candid, we were 16 months ago,\" Chief Executive Dave Lewis told reporters.\n\"More customers are buying more things more often at Tesco,\" he said, highlighting fourth quarter UK volume growth of 3.3 percent and a 2.8 percent rise in customer transactions.\nHowever, Lewis warned that profit improvement \"won't be a smooth line\" as Tesco cuts prices and invests in the quality of its products to help protect its leading position in Britain.\nShares in Tesco, which controls 28 percent of Britain's grocery market, have risen 31 percent so far this year on recovery hopes but fell as much as 5 percent in morning trading.\nSales at British stores open over a year rose 0.9 percent in the 13 weeks to Feb. 27, the final quarter of its financial year, building on growth over its six-week Christmas trading period.\nTesco also reported a full year operating profit before one-off items of 944 million pounds ($1.3 billion), ahead of analysts' expectations of 932 million pounds and the 940 million pounds it made in 2014-15.\nThat is a far cry from the trading profit of 3.97 billion pounds that Tesco generated in 2011-12 when it could seemingly do little wrong.\nPRICE CUTS\nSales, profit and asset values at Tesco have been hammered by changes to shopping habits and the rise of German discounters Aldi and Lidl, while the accounting scandal severely dented its reputation.\nTesco said price cuts in a \"challenging, deflationary and uncertain market\" would impact the pace of profit growth in the 2016-17 financial year, particularly in the first half.\nPrior to Wednesday's update, the consensus forecast for  operating profit before one-off items in 2016-17 was 1.25 billion pounds.\n\"If we were to achieve that (consensus) and make all the investments we want to make, that is a significant achievement,\" said Lewis.\nFormer Unilever (ULVR.L) executive Lewis has impressed investors with his decisive steps since replacing sacked predecessor Phil Clarke in September 2014.\nHe is trying to revive Tesco with a focus on lower prices, streamlined product ranges, better customer service and new simplified relationships with suppliers, the root cause of the accounting issues that are the subject of a criminal investigation by Britain's Serious Fraud Office.\nLewis has also sold assets including Tesco's South Korean business, and cut costs, including thousands of jobs, to reduce the firm's debt burden. Tesco's net debt now stands at 5.1 billion pounds, down 40 percent year-on-year.\nTesco's better performance was broad based, with positive and improving underlying sales also achieved in Ireland, continental Europe and Asia and improved sales across all store formats and categories.\nWhile analysts welcomed the return to UK sales growth, they point out that the discounters continue to open stores and take market share and competition with traditional rivals, Sainsbury's (SBRY.L), Asda (WMT.N) and Morrisons (MRW.L), remains intense.\nThey also note significant cost pressures from the UK minimum wage, business rates and rental costs and uncertainty regarding Britain's EU referendum in June.\nAnalyst Clive Black at Shore Capital, who has a \"hold\" rating on Tesco shares, said Lewis deserved \"considerable credit for steering this near retail ship wreck to calmer waters, where the group's 'engineers', can and are now making progress.\"\n(Editing by Keith Weir)\nFile photo of a Tesco supermarket seen at dusk in an 'art deco' style building at Perivale in west London, Britain, January 6, 2015.

  "articleText" : "Company has promised $3.5 billion of operating cost savings\nShell plans consolidation of some offices around the world\nShare on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp\nRoyal Dutch Shell Plc said it would cut about 2,800 jobs to meet a pledge of reducing operating costs by $3.5 billion following its takeover of BG Group Plc. \nThat equates to 3 percent of Shell and BG’s combined workforce as The Hague-based company consolidates offices and its administration structure once the acquisition is completed, it said in a statement on Monday. The two companies both have offices in a number of countries, including the U.K., Australia and Brazil.\nOil’s slump has prompted some investors to question if Shell is paying too much for BG, even though the acquisition will make the combined company the world’s biggest liquefied natural gas player and give it oil and gas assets from Australia to Kazakhstan and Brazil. To convince shareholders to approve the deal, Shell has\npromised cost savings.\n“Shell expects the restructuring will be required to achieve the expected benefits of the recommended combination, including previously disclosed and reported-on pretax synergies of $3.5 billion,” the company said. \nBG had 5,143 employees and Shell 94,000 at the end of 2014, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Shell has already announced 7,500 cuts in employee and contractor jobs this year.\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal. LEARN MORE\n",

  "articleText" : "BERENBERG RESUMES BOOKER GROUP WITH 'BUY' - TARGET 189 PENCE\n---------\nLiberum Cuts Shell Price Target To 2,120p From 2,230p, Reiterates Hold\n----------\nCOMPANIES - FTSE 100\n----------\nSky posted a big increase in pretax profit for its first half, boosted by a rise in revenue and exceptional gains from its sale of its stakes in ITV and the National Geographic Channel, in its first results that incorporate its acquisitions of Sky Italia and a majority stake in Sky Deutschland. Sky posted a pretax profit of GBP1.21 billion for the half year to end-December, compared to GBP507 million a year before, on revenue of GBP4.30 billion compared to GBP3.67 billion. Profit was boosted by a GBP492 million gain from the sale of its 6.4% stake in ITV PLC and a GBP296 million gain from the sale of its stake in the National Geographic Channel. Sky proposed an interim dividend of 12.30 pence, up from 12.00 pence a year before.\n----------\nVodafone Group is set to make its first move into the \"multiplay\" market of bundled telecoms and internet services in the next few weeks, the Financial Times reported. Vodafone will unveil plans in the next couple of weeks for a push into the UK consumer broadband market in a bid to counter the shift by rivals BT Group and Sky to add mobile to their fixed line services.\n----------\nHargreaves Lansdown reported a drop in first-half pretax profit despite a rise in assets under administration over the course of the six months, in what it described as a \"muted\" time for stocks and retail investors. In a statement, the investment management product provider said pretax profit declined to GBP101.9 million in the six months ended December 31 from GBP104.1 million in the corresponding period last year. Assets under administration rose to GBP49.1 billion at the end of 2014, from GBP46.9 billion six months earlier and GBP43.4 billion at the same stage last year.\n----------\nStandard & Poor's late Tuesday cut its long-term credit ratings on a number of European lenders, including Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland Group and Standard Chartered, because the ratings agency thinks state aid in the event of a crisis is now unlikely due to measures taken by European and domestic authorities. S&P downgraded the long-term credit ratings of Barclays and Lloyds to BBB from A-, while RBS' long-term credit rating was downgraded by two notches to BBB-. HSBC's long-term credit rating was lowered to A from A+, while Standard Chartered's was downgraded to A- from A.\n----------\nNo progress was made in negotiations between Royal Dutch Shell and union leaders in the US on Tuesday, Reuters reported, as they continued haggling over a new wage contract for US refinery workers who have been on strike since the weekend. The two camps have been at an impasse since the United Steelworkers union called for industrial action on Sunday for the first time since 1980 at nine plants, which represent a combined 10% of US refining capacity, after saying Shell had walked away from the negotiating table when the talks broke down.\n----------\nCOMPANIES - FTSE 250\n----------\nSynergy Health said it is trading in line with its expectations for the year on the back of a rise in revenue in the first nine months. The FTSE 250-listed company, which provides outsourced support services to healthcare-related markets, said its revenue for the first nine months of its financial year to December 28 was up 5.7% to GBP303.1 million. It said its revenue was held back in part by sterling strength, with constant currency revenue for the period up 9.6%.\n----------\nChemical manufacturer Victrex said it \"has seen a solid start to 2015\", reporting a rise in revenue during the first quarter of its financial year, driven by increased sales volumes from its consumer electronics business. In the first quarter to the end of December, Victrex generated GBP59.8 million in revenue, a 14% rise from GBP52.4 million a year earlier. The company said sales volumes of its polymers rose 42% in the quarter to 967 tonnes from 679 tonnes a year earlier. The strong volume comparative in the first quarter largely reflects the company's current consumer electronics business, which did not contribute to the quarter last year, it said.\n----------\nCOMPANIES - LONDON MAIN MARKET AND AIM\n----------\nRyanair Holdings reported strong growth in passenger numbers in January, and said its planes were more full than a year earlier, confirming a trend it reported on Monday when it reported its third quarter results. Europe's largest low-cost carrier said passenger numbers were up by 1.3 million on the year in January to over 5.98 million, while its load factor rose to 83%, from 71% a year earlier. Passenger numbers in the 12 months to the end of January were 87.8 million, up 8% on the previous 12 months.\n----------\nDaily Mail and General Trust reported a rise in underlying revenue for the first quarter, with revenue increasing in its business-to-business arm but falling for its dmg media newspaper business. The company said its revenue for the first quarter to the end of December was GBP476 million, up 1% year-on-year on an underlying basis. Underlying revenue growth in its business-to-business arm, which comprises its Risk Management Solutions, dmg information, and dmg events arms, as well as Euromoney Institutional Investor, was up 4% for the quarter. Revenue for the dmg media newspaper business was down 2% on an underlying basis, with circulation revenue falling 4% on the back of declining volumes. MailOnline digital advertising revenue rose 21% in the quarter, but print advertising revenue fell 10%.\n----------\nSelf-storage company Lok'nStore Group reported strong trading in the first half of its financial year, with its self-storage revenue rising and document storage business improving. The company said trading in the first half to the end of January \"remained brisk\". First-half revenue in its core self-storage business was up 16% year-on-year, with its self-storage unit occupancy rate up 5.5% year-on-year at the end of January. Its average price per square foot let for the half was up 6.7% year-on-year.\n----------\nInterior furnishings company Walker Greenbank said it expects its pretax profit to come in at the top end of analysts' consensus for the year on the back of a rise in sales. The company said it has performed well since its half-year results were published in October and expects group sales for the full year to January 31 to be up 6.4% to GBP83 million. As a result, it expects adjusted pretax profit for the year to be at the top end of analyst guidance. According to Morningstar, the consensus guidance for the group's pretax profit is GBP7.7 million.\n----------\nAnglo Pacific Group said it has bought a royalty interest on coal sales from a major coal mine in Australia for USD65 million in cash and shares, said it will help fund the deal with a share placing, and also proposed an enhanced dividend policy to reflect the deal. In a statement, the resources company said it has agreed with a private party to buy its royalty interest in the Narrabri coal project, a thermal coal and pulverised coal injection mine located in New South Wales, Australia. The royalty entitles the holder to royalty payments equal to 1% of gross revenue on all coal produced from the area covered by the royalty.\n----------\nMedia company Future said it has made a solid start to 2015, with trading in line with the end of 2014 so far. Chairman Peter Allen is set to tell the company's annual general meeting that trading for the company has made a \"solid and encouraging\" start to the year.\n----------\nCOMPANIES - INTERNATIONAL\n----------\nDiversified media and entertainment conglomerate Walt Disney said its first quarter profit rose 19% from last year, driven mainly by higher attendance at its domestic theme parks and strong sales of merchandise based on the 2013 box-office hit \"Frozen\". The company's quarterly earnings per share also handily beat analysts' estimate as did its quarterly revenue. Meanwhile, Disney is postponing the opening of its Disneyland Shanghai theme park to the first half of 2016, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier Tuesday. The company had planned to open the park in 2015. The project has been on the works for more than a decade, and was first slated to open in 2008.\n----------\nJM Smucker announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Big Heart Pet Brands in cash and stock transaction valued at approximately USD5.8 billion, which includes about USD2.6 billion of net debt. Big Heart Pet Brands, which changed its name from Del Monte Corp last year, is a stand-alone producer, distributor, and marketer of pet food and pet snacks in the US.\n----------\nJapanese auto major Toyota Motor reported that its third-quarter net income attributable to the company rose to JPY600.00 billion from the previous year's JPY525.4 billion. Quarterly net revenue grew to JPY7.170 trillion from JPY6.585 trillion last year. Looking ahead for fiscal 2015, the company now expects net income attributable to the company to be JPY2.13 trillion and net revenue JPY27.00 trillion.\n----------\nSony announced its consolidated financial results forecast for the third quarter ended December 31, 2014. Income before income taxes is expected to increase JPY76.4 billion year-on-year to JPY164.7 billion. Net income attributable to stockholders is expected to increase JPY62.7 billion year-on-year to JPY89.0 billion. Sony expects sales and operating revenue to be JPY2.56 trillion, an increase of 6.1% compared to the same quarter of the previous fiscal year.\n----------\n",

Some of the proceeds may be returned to shareholders. Numis said:\nIHG had made it clear that the hotel was on the market. This looks like a very acceptable price (22 times EBIT) to us and the achieved price is some $150m above our expectation.\nCredit Suisse said:\nFollowing... the disposal of the Hong Kong InterContinental for $938m, we update estimates to also capture an assumed $1.5bn special dividend to be paid in the second quarter 2016.

Additionally, Solan timing (and costs) to first oil seems to have stabilised and Pakistan assets have attracted an approach.

  "articleText" : "Technology News | Mon Feb 29, 2016 | 2:44pm EST\nAmazon to attack UK grocery market with Morrisons deal\nBy James Davey and Kate Holton | LONDON\nLONDON Amazon has launched its biggest foray into food outside of the United States with a deal with British supermarket Morrisons to offer fresh and frozen goods to customers, in some places as quickly as under one hour.\nEnabling the online retail giant to compete with Britain's biggest supermarket stores and smallest local shops, the deal opens another front on Amazon's assault on the 178 billion pounds ($247 billion) British grocery market, already hammered by a brutal price war and changing shopping habits.\nAmazon will now add hundreds of fresh and frozen products to its existing offering of packaged grocery goods, setting it up to take on Tesco, Sainsbury's and Wal-Mart's Asda, as well as online specialist Ocado, in one of the world's most developed online retail markets.\n\"The advance of Amazon as a participant in UK grocery is a potential challenge to the whole trade, in time,\" Shore Capital retail analyst Clive Black said on Monday. \"Any new entrant is, but particularly the American behemoth.\"\nThe tie-up boosted shares of Morrisons, Britain's fourth largest supermarket, which has been a laggard in online sales. Since 2013 it has outsourced logistics for its own online food business to Ocado.\nMorrisons shares rose 5.6 percent. Those of Ocado fell 9.3 percent on fears the deal would increase competition and reduce the likelihood that Amazon could one day buy it. Market leader Tesco's shares fell by 3 percent.\n\"Tesco could soon be about to find out what it's like to be David rather than Goliath,\" said Retail Vision consultant John Ibbotson. Amazon has a market cap of $261 billion.\nThe UK grocery market has been convulsed in recent years by thrifty shoppers turning to discounters Aldi and Lidl, convenience stores and online shops. The British Retail Consortium predicts that 900,000 retail jobs could go by 2025 as the industry moves online.\nAmazon, the world's largest online retailer, launched a fresh food offering in Seattle in 2007 and has moved to a handful of other U.S. cities since then, but it has struggled to find the best pricing model, with fresh food proving one of the toughest nuts to crack.\nAfter waiving the membership fee for several years, Amazon finally said last year it would begin charging customers $299 a year for its Prime Fresh membership in the U.S.\nIts expansion into food in the rest of the world has focused so far just on packaged goods due to the complexity of delivering fresh and frozen products. However, it is keen to extend its offering, just as supermarkets are increasingly competing on its home turf by selling more non-food products online.\nRANGE LIMITATION\nThe Morrisons tie-up stops short of replicating its broader U.S. Amazon Fresh service, which offers about 20,000 chilled, frozen and perishable products and items from local shops that analysts have long speculated Amazon was targeting for the UK.\nBut it gives Amazon a platform to attack a UK online grocery market predicted to nearly double to 17.2 billion pounds in the five years to 2020, according to industry research group IGD.\nIt has offered some food and drink items to British customers since 2010, and in November it extended a packaged groceries offer already available in Germany and Japan to Amazon Prime subscription members in Britain. Last year it added a small range of chilled and frozen items to its Prime Now service which offers one-hour delivery in Britain's two biggest cities.\nAmazon has also begun surveying UK customers about their use of restaurant delivery services, in what analysts said was likely the first step in an international expansion of a business it rolled out in the U.S last September.\nMorrisons, with a smaller footprint in the more affluent areas of London and the south east of England than Tesco and Sainsbury's, may have gambled that it could cope better with the arrival of Amazon which would typically target those areas.\nMorrisons makes half of all the own brand and fresh food it sells, a greater share than other British supermarkets, and has spare capacity to service Amazon's needs.\nMorrisons announced separate plans on Monday to extend its own online grocery deliveries to the whole of the UK, in agreement with Ocado. It would take space in a new Ocado London warehouse while Ocado will provide Morrisons with software to fulfill online orders from its own stores.\nFor Morrisons, a tie-up with outside giants like Amazon might be described as \"letting the barbarians in\", said analysts at brokerage Bernstein.\nNevertheless, the deal could be \"a convenient divide-and conquer outcome where Amazon and Morrisons specialize where they are best and support each other mutually,\" Bernstein said.\n\"Morrisons may feel that Amazon isn't really a threat for its smaller stores in the North of England; on the contrary on our recent store visit, we saw a nice new shiny Amazon locker unit for picking up Amazon parcels.\"\n($1 = 0.7212 pounds)\n(Additional reporting by Emma Thomasson in Berlin and Mari Saito in San Francisco; Editing by Peter Graff)\nEmployees of Amazon India are seen behind a glass bearing the company's logo inside its office in Bengaluru, India, August 14, 2015.

  "articleText" : "Barclays’s Next CEO Should Be Investment Banker, Aberdeen Says\nStephen Morris and Sarah Jones\nJuly 23, 2015 — 11:07 AM EDT\nShare on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp\nBarclays Plc should pick an investment banker as its next chief executive officer because the lender’s underperforming securities unit requires further restructuring, Aberdeen Asset Management Plc’s Martin Gilbert said.\n“To try and be everything to everyone is not a great strategy now for an investment bank,” Aberdeen’s CEO said in a telephone interview on Thursday. “What they should do is concentrate at what they are good at. That’s why it needs someone with a bit of investment banking, as well other banking, experience, and they’re more difficult to find.”\nChairman John McFarlane, 68, fired CEO Antony Jenkins, a former retail banker, this month after he clashed over strategy with investment-banking chief Tom King, people with knowledge of the matter have said. McFarlane has pledged to boost investment and revenue in Barclays’s best performing units and double the share price over the next three or four years.\nBarclays is among European banks expected to cut back debt trading as stricter capital rules make the business unsustainable. Credit Suisse Group AG shares surged on Thursday after CEO Tidjane Thiam said he’ll shrink parts of its investment bank because “regulation has developed in an unsupportive or unfavorable way.”\nMcFarlane “is an outstanding chairman, I know him well personally and have the highest regard for him,” Gilbert said. Aberdeen owns about 2 percent of Barclays, making it the 11th biggest investor in the London-based bank, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nDifficult Job\nThe CEO role is difficult to fill because Barclays, Britain’s second-largest bank by assets, is a “complex organization” and “it needs a Bill Winters type to be CEO,” Gilbert said.\nWinters took over from Peter Sands at Standard Chartered Plc in June after the CEO failed to arrest falling revenue and snowballing loan impairments linked to commodity lending. Winters, 53, is the former co-head of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s investment bank.\nMcFarlane has also said it’s essential for a new CEO to have investment-banking experience because Jenkins “found it difficult to deal with” shrinking the division.\nCitigroup Inc. analysts listed three internal candidates in a report on Wednesday -- Finance Director Tushar Morzaria, Chief Operating Officer Jonathan Moulds and Personal and Corporate Banking CEO Ashok Vaswani -- and three external: BlueMountain Capital’s Jes Staley, Morgan Stanley’s Colm Kelleher and Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.’s Mike Smith.\nAberdeen shares plummeted as much as 8.4 percent on Thursday after the market rout in China soured investor appetite for Asia and emerging market equities, exacerbating client redemptions. Barclays reports second-quarter results July 29 and Standard Chartered on Aug. 5.\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal. LEARN MORE\n",

REUTERS/Suzanne Plunkett\n4/4\nBy Ben Hirschler | LONDON\nLONDON Shire Plc has agreed to buy U.S. group NPS Pharmaceuticals Inc for $5.2 billion, the Dublin-based drugmaker's biggest acquisition yet as it seeks to strengthen  its position in the lucrative field of medicines for rare diseases.\nThe takeover continues the breakneck pace of deal-making seen last year in the pharmaceuticals sector, as companies jockey for promising assets amid a wave of new drugs emerging from research laboratories, and Shire's chief executive, Flemming Ornskov, told Reuters he would keep looking for more deals to grow the company into a biotech powerhouse.\nShire will pay $46 per NPS share, representing a premium of nearly 10 percent to NPS's Friday close, the two companies said on Sunday.\nThe move will not come as a huge surprise, since Shire was first linked to NPS in May 2014. When plans for Shire to sell itself to AbbVie Inc fell apart in October, Shire said it could take another look at previous deal prospects and reports of Shire's interest resurfaced in mid-December.\n\"This is about growth and rare diseases, and it fits hand in glove with our strategy and our franchise,\" Ornskov said.\nShire expects the all-cash deal to add to its adjusted earnings from 2016 onward. It believes it can achieve cost savings of approximately 25 percent to 35 percent of consensus forecasts for NPS's standalone future operating cost base from 2017.\nAnalysts at Jefferies said the deal could boost earnings per share from 2016 by at least 12 percent. Shares in Shire edged slightly lower in morning trade on Monday, however, since the NPS deal is likely to reduce talk of Shire as a takeover target.\nCALCULATED RISK\nThe acquisition of New Jersey-based NPS will give Shire two significant new drugs. Gattex, a treatment for short-bowel syndrome (SBS), is already on the market, while Natpara, for hypoparathyroidism, is awaiting approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\nThe FDA is expected to decide on the Natpara application by Jan. 24. \"I am confident that Natpara will be approved on the 24th, however ... there is absolutely no guarantee,\" said NPS's  chief executive, Francois Nader. \"Given our interactions with the FDA, I believe it will be approved.\"\nNader called Shire's decision to conclude a deal before a decision a calculated risk on their part that nevertheless \"would provide the joint company the opportunity to deploy the most resources in supporting the launch\".\nThe consensus of analysts' forecasts for the two NPS medicines point to annual sales of $509 million and $534 million respectively by 2019, according to Thomson Reuters Cortellis, although Ornskov believes they may bring in more.\n\"Both of them have significant sales potential and some have mentioned the word 'blockbuster',\" he said. The term blockbuster applies to a drug with sales of $1 billion or more.\nThe drugs treat serious but rare disorders, which means they can command high prices. SBS is a potentially fatal gastrointestinal disorder that can leave patients dependent on  intravenous feeding, while hypoparathyroidism is an endocrine disease cause by absent or damaged parathyroid glands.\n\"ALWAYS CONSIDERING NEXT DEAL\"\nShire, which will make a tender offer for NPS shares, has secured an $850 million bank loan which, together with cash reserves and an  existing $2.1 billion five-year revolving credit facility, will pay for the deal.\nEven though NPS is a record acquisition for Shire, Ornskov expects the deal, which could close in the first quarter of this year, to be paid off quickly.\n\"We are incredibly cash-generative and this will add to that, so this does not prevent us from considering further deals,\" he said. \"Shire is always considering the next deal.\"\nShire's coffers were boosted by more than $1.6 billion when it got a windfall break-up fee after AbbVie abandoned its $55 billion takeover deal.\nCitigroup and Lazard acted as joint financial advisers to Shire, with Goldman Sachs and Leerink advising NPS.\n(Additional reporting by Natalie Grover and Deena Beasley; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Greg Mahlich)\nNext In Deals\n",

REUTERS/Phil Noble\nBy Ben Hirschler | LONDON\nLONDON U.S. health regulators declined to approve a fixed-dose diabetes drug combination from AstraZeneca, delaying its launch and dealing a blow to an important plank of the drugmaker's business.\nAstraZeneca said on Friday it had received a so-called complete response letter from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) stating that more clinical data were required before it could approve the combination of saxagliptin and dapagliflozin.\nSuch letters typically outline concerns and conditions that must be addressed to gain U.S. approval and the move means AstraZeneca faces an unspecified wait in getting its potential blockbuster drug cocktail to market.\nDeutsche Bank analyst Richard Parkes said the FDA move probably reflected lack of data on the new formulation rather than safety or efficacy concerns and it seemed likely a launch would simply be delayed by between 12 and 24 months.\nMorgan Stanley analysts said a best-case scenario was an 8-10 months' delay but this could extend to a few years if new clinical trials were needed.\nLast year, during its defense against a $118 billion takeover attempt by Pfizer, AstraZeneca predicted the saxagliptin and dapagliflozin fixed-dose combination could generate peak annual sales of $3 billion, out of total diabetes revenue of $8 billion expected by 2023.\nShares in the company were flat by late morning, underperforming a 1.5 percent rise in the European drugs sector.\nAstraZeneca said the FDA wanted to see more clinical trial data from ongoing or completed studies and it might also require information from new studies.\nThe individual component drugs in the new mix are already approved and marketed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, under the brand names Onglyza and Farxiga, and the FDA move is not expected to affect their status, the company added.\nSales of Onglyza reached $391 million in the first half of 2015, with recently launched Farxiga selling $205 million.\nOnglyza is a type of diabetes medicine known as a DPP-IV inhibitor, similar to Merck's highly successful Januvia.\nFarxiga belongs to a newer drug class called SGLT2 inhibitors, which have created great excitement since a clinical trial last month showed that Eli Lilly's Jardiance slashed deaths in patients at risk of heart attack and stroke.\n(Editing by William Hardy, Jane Merriman, Adrian Croft)\nNext In Internal Reuters News Room Exclusives And Wins MOL\n",

  "articleText" : "Deals | Mon Jan 11, 2016 | 5:30pm EST\nDrugmaker Shire to buy Baxalta for $32 billion after six-month pursuit\nBy Ben Hirschler and Paul Sandle | LONDON\nLONDON Drugmaker Shire Plc (SHP.L) clinched its six-month pursuit of Baxalta International Inc BXLT.N on Monday with an agreed $32 billion cash and stock offer, catapulting it to a leading position in treating rare diseases.\nThe London-listed group, which first approached the U.S. company with an all-stock offer in July, won over the maker of treatments for rare blood conditions, cancers and immune system disorders after adding a cash sweetener.\nShire's U.S.-traded shares (SHPG.O) fell 9 percent, however, as investors worry about a potential competitive threat from Roche ROG.VX to Baxalta's critically important haemophilia franchise, and on nerves over the price offered and a cost savings forecast that Jefferies analysts called \"somewhat disappointing.\"\nThe deal marks a strong start to mergers and acquisitions in healthcare in 2016 after the sector had its biggest deal-making streak in history last year, with global transactions totaling $673 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nIt also highlights the appeal of medicines for rare diseases targeting small groups of patients for which drugmakers can charge hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.\n\"Together we will have the number one platform in rare diseases with a strong foundation for future growth,\" Shire Chief Executive Officer Flemming Ornskov told reporters, after unveiling his company's most ambitious acquisition yet.\nShareholders will receive $18 in cash and 0.1482 Shire American depositary share per Baxalta share, implying a total value of $45.57 per share based on Jan. 8 prices. That is 37.5 percent above Baxalta's price on Aug. 3, before Shire went public with its interest.\nIllinois-based Baxalta, which was spun off last year from Baxter International Inc (BAX.N), rejected Shire's previous $30 billion all-stock offer in August, arguing it significantly undervalued the company.\nBut Ornskov relentlessly pursued Baxalta, seeking to pressure it into agreeing to a deal by meeting with Baxalta's major shareholders over a period of months.\nThat enabled it to sidestep a hostile deal in which it would have faced takeover defences including a \"poison pill\" that stopped unwanted suitors from buying more than 10 percent of the company and a hard-to-replace board.\nShares of Baxalta closed down 2.3 percent at $39.10 on the New York Stock Exchange, giving back earlier gains.\nTAX BENEFITS\nShire had initially offered only stock due to concerns a cash element might jeopardize the tax-free status of Baxalta's spin-off from Baxter. However, Ornskov said he was confident that adding $18 in cash would maintain this tax-free status.\n\"We came out without any doubt that this was not jeopardising the tax-free nature of the spin,\" Ornskov said.\nTogether, the two companies said they expected to deliver double-digit sales growth with more than $20 billion in annual revenue by 2020.\nWith annual operating cost synergies of more than $500     million, additional revenue synergies and tax benefits from Shire's Irish domicile, Shire said it expected the transaction to boost non-GAAP diluted earnings from 2017.\nBaxalta brings Shire a strong position in haemophilia treatments, although that could face a serious challenge by late 2017 or 2018 from Roche's experimental antibody ACE910 that received breakthrough designation - given to potentially important advances over current treatments - from U.S. health regulators. The Roche drug has a long half-life that could allow for less frequent dosing.\n\"A lot of people don't like the deal\" largely due to its  dependence on Baxalta's haemophilia franchise, said John Boris, analyst with Suntrust Robinson Humphrey.\n\"They believe Shire is buying an asset that is going to be under pressure, so it may not reach the $20 billion revenue by 2020 target,\" Boris said.\nUBS analysts cautioned that Baxalta could actually dilute Shire earnings from 2019 to 2023 before being accretive again from 2024.\nThanks to its base in Dublin, the combined company is expected to have an effective tax rate of 16 to 17 percent by 2017, down from around 23 percent for Baxalta, making the deal the latest transaction to result in lower tax rates.\nOrnskov has stepped up his acquisition efforts in the rare diseases space after a planned takeover by U.S. drugmaker AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N) fell through last year. He bought NPS Pharmaceuticals for $5.2 billion in February and Dyax for $5.9 billion in November.\nShire signed an $18 billion facility to help finance its latest purchase.\nShire was advised by Evercore, Morgan Stanley, Barclays and Deutsche Bank. Baxalta was advised by Goldman Sachs and Citi.\nAccording to Freeman/Thomson Reuters estimates, Shire's advisers could be in line for fees of $50 million-$60 million and Baxalta's may earn $70 million-$80 million.\nBaxalta said the termination fee on the Shire merger was equal to $369 million.\n(Additional reporting by Caroline Humer and Bill Berkrot in New York and Anjuli Davies in London; Editing by Keith Weir and Matthew Lewis)\nA sign sits in front of Shire's manufacturing facility in Lexington, Massachusetts July 18, 2014.

Freeport-McMoRan Inc. and Teck Resources Ltd. lost more than 3 percent in U.S. trading. Swiss commodities trader and miner Glencore Plc fell to the lowest closing price since its 2011 initial public offering.\nGauge of producers at six-year low\nInvestors are bailing on commodities as China’s economy expands at the slowest pace since 1990 and the Federal Reserve moves closer to raising borrowing costs. More than $140 billion has been erased this year from the value of the Bloomberg World Mining Index of the biggest producers.\n“We’re probably not too far off a global industrial recession,” Colin Hamilton, London-based head of commodities research at Macquarie Group Ltd., said in interview with Bloomberg Television Wednesday. “The only thing that can turn it around are strong capacity cuts.”\nCopper fell 1.7 percent and gold futures retreated for a 10th day in the longest run of losses since 1996. Plunging metal prices are eroding profits for miners across the globe as a glut of raw materials faces waning demand.\nThe the 14-member FTSE 350 Mining Index sank 4.6 percent to a six-year low. Anglo American Plc fell 5.6 percent to 813.50 pence, the lowest since 2002. Rio Tinto Group dropped 3.6 percent to 2,502.5 pence. Glencore, led by billionaire Ivan Glasenberg, retreated 5.4 percent to 228 pence.\nBHP Cuts\nBHP plans to cut production of three of its four most important commodities, it said Wednesday. It plans to trim output of coal, petroleum and copper in fiscal 2016 while iron ore, which is down 27 percent this year, is the only of its so-called four pillars forecast to post an increase.\n“The bad news is yet to play out in terms of iron ore oversupply and we think demand conditions are going to get worse for copper as well,” Richard Knights, a mining analyst at Liberum Capital Ltd. in London, said by phone.\n“We’re probably not too far off a global industrial recession”\n“It needs to get worse before it gets better,” he said. “I don’t see demand being the driver of a recovery, so it will have to be supply-led discipline and we are not really seeing that yet.”\nSociete Generale SA expects surpluses in copper, aluminum and tin this year. Norsk Hydro ASA said on Tuesday that China’s exports were compounding a global aluminum glut and damaging the industry.\nGold fell as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. predicted further declines and investors sold more through funds. Prices reached a five-year low of $1,080 an ounce on Monday and holdings in exchange-traded products are the lowest since 2009.\nThe rout sapped investor confidence in gold miners this week, with the 30-member Philadelphia Stock Exchange Gold and Silver Index reaching the lowest since 2001. A five-day losing streak through Monday wiped $19 billion off the index, which includes Barrick Gold Corp. and Newmont Mining Corp.\nRead this next:\n",

REUTERS/Dylan Martinez\nBy Nina Chestney | LONDON\nLONDON Britain will have enough electricity supply to meet demand this winter after securing emergency back-up capacity last year, National Grid said on Friday.\nBritain is forecast to have a surplus power margin of 5.5 percent this winter, similar to what was forecast last winter, National Grid said in its 2016/17 winter review and consultation.\n\"We believe the margin is manageable and that we have the right tools and services available, including extra power we can call on if we need it, for times of highest demand,\" said Cordi O’Hara, director of UK system operations at National Grid.\nConcerns about power shortages have risen in Britain due to ageing nuclear power plants, a plan to close coal-fired power plants by 2025 and weak economic conditions for investment in new gas plants needed to replace them.\nThe electricity margin would have been just 0.1 percent if National Grid had not procured 3.5 gigawatts (GW) of back-up supply, the grid operator said.\nIn the winter of 2004/2005 the margin fell to just 0.7 percent but National Grid said factors such as increased wind generation and supply via interconnectors mean it does not compare years on a like-for-like basis.\nNational Grid's Supplemental Balancing Reserve (SBR) pays generators to provide back-up power over the winter months when demand is high.\nFrom next year, this will be replaced by the government’s so-called capacity auction. On Friday, the government said it would procure 53.8 GW of capacity under the scheme for winter 2017-18.\nGas supplies should be enough to meet demand for this winter and will come from a wide range of sources, including domestic production, imports from continental Europe and liquefied natural gas, the report said.\nBritain will likely have record low levels of stored gas this winter as Rough, its largest storage site, is shut until at least August due for testing.\nBritain depends largely on stored reserves to manage winter demand spikes while domestic stockpiles also help ensure supply. Reserves are typically replenished during summer months when demand and prices are low.\n\"If Rough is not completely filled before winter, or if it\nis not returned to normal operation, our analysis of available supplies suggests that there will still be sufficient capacity\navailable to the market to meet demand,\" National Grid said.\nIt forecast that on a cold day supply from the Netherlands through the BBL pipeline at 40 million cubic metres (mcm) per day for winter 2016/17, the same level forecast for last winter.\nThis is despite a Dutch government decision last month to lower the cap on production at the Groningen gas field.\n(Additional reporting by Susanna Twidale; editing by Jason Neely)\nNext In UK\n",

  "articleText" : "Nov 24th 2016 09:15 AM\n-\nBritish banks Lloyds  (LSE: LLOY) and Barclays  (LSE: BARC) have seen their share prices rise recently on the back of Donald Trump's US election win. But which offers the best investment opportunity?\nEarnings\nA glance at the two banks'  income statements reveals that in recent years, Lloyds has had more earnings momentum than rival Barclays. Lloyds has generated earnings growth of 29% over the last three financial years, reporting adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 6.6p, 8.1p and 8.5p for FY2013-2015. Barclays has seen more modest growth of 9% in this time, reporting earnings of 15.3p, 17.3p and 16.6p.\nCity analysts forecast consecutive earnings declines for Lloyds, with FY2016-2017 earnings of 7.2p (-18%) and 6.6p (-9%) estimated. By contrast, earnings at Barclays are predicted to fall and then rise, with 11.4p (-46%) and 18.7p (+39%) forecast. \nIs there a definitive winner here? It's a tough call. With Lloyds generating 100% of its income in the UK compared to 48% for Barclays, much is likely to depend on how Brexit affects the UK economy and the implications this has for the financial sector. \nDividends\nHowever, when it comes to dividends, it's easier to pick a winner. There's no doubt Barclays trumped Lloyds in recent years in terms of dividend consistency, paying out 6.5p per share each year for FY2013-2015, compared to Lloyds' 0.00p, 0.75p and 2.75p in this time.\nHowever looking forward it's a different story as Barclays announced earlier this year that it would be cutting its dividend for FY2016. Barclays is now forecast to pay just 3p this year and next year, which on the current share price, equates to a yield of just 1.4%.\nBut Lloyds is forecast to pay 3.16p this year and 3.7p next year, yields of 5.4% and 6.3% respectively, and the bank has reiterated its commitment to a progressive and sustainable ordinary dividend. Lloyds clearly has the momentum here, and while the bank's future dividend payouts are certainly not guaranteed, I believe that Lloyds has the brighter dividend prospects in the near term. \nPrice\nLloyds' shares fell heavily after the Brexit result and are down 19% year-to-date. With analysts forecasting EPS of 7.2p for FY2016,  the bank trades on a forward looking P/E multiple of 8.2.\nBarclays shares are down just 4% for the year now and at the current share price of 210p, the bank trades on a forward looking P/E ratio of 18.4. On this metric, Lloyds appears to be the cheaper stock.\nWhich stock would I buy?\nOne thing that appeals to me about Lloyds is the bank's simplified business model. It focuses on domestic retail and small business banking and is 100% UK-focused. Its cost-to-income ratio is low at 47.5% and the bank recently reported a strong Common Equity Tier 1 capital (CET1) of 13.4%.\nBarclays has a more complex business model, including an investment banking arm and more diverse geographic exposure. Many of its 'non-core' assets have underperformed of late, and as a result, the bank is looking to dispose of non-core holdings and simplify its group structure. Barclays recently reported a cost-to-income ratio of 79% for Q3, and a CET1 ratio of 11.6%.\nThere are still many risks facing the banking sector, however if I had to choose between Lloyds and Barclays, I would pick Lloyds on the back of its low price multiple, simplified structure and exciting dividend prospects.\nNeither Lloyds nor Barclays made this exclusive portfolio\nWhile Lloyds and Barclays may continue to perform well, neither stock made the cut when analysts at The Motley Fool put together the portfolio listed in this exclusive report:  Five stocks to retire on .\nThe report lists five high quality FTSE 100 holdings , all of which have superb long-term prospects according to the team at The Motley Fool. \nIf you're looking for core portfolio holdings to buy and keep, this report could be an excellent place to start.

They had closed up 66 cents at $15.62 in regular trading.\nIt is unclear whether Buffett or one of his portfolio managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, invested in Kinder Morgan, though investments of this size are often not Buffett's.\nNonetheless, investors often view such disclosures as a signal of where Buffett and his deputies see value.\nBerkshire has also been boosting its stake in Phillips 66 , and as of Friday had spent $1.08 billion this year on the oil refiner's stock. That gave it a 14.3 percent stake now worth about $5.91 billion.\nKinder Morgan shares have fallen by nearly two-thirds since April as falling oil prices cut into profitability.\nThat plunge has prompted the Houston-based company to lower capital spending, and in December cut its dividend for the first time.\n\"KMI has many of the qualities Buffett looks for in his investments, including stable, fee-based assets which generate significant amounts of cash flow,\" Morningstar Inc analyst Peggy Connerty said in an email, referring to Kinder Morgan's ticker.\nGiven the stock price decline, and Kinder Morgan's plan to improve its balance sheet without issuing new shares this year, \"for a long-term oriented investor KMI is a decent name to own,\" she said.\nKinder Morgan spokeswoman Melissa Ruiz said: \"We are pleased that others see the value in the company that we see.\"\nAccording to Tuesday's filing, Wells Fargo & Co  remained Berkshire's biggest U.S. stock holding at $26.08 billion, followed by Kraft Heinz Co at $23.69 billion.\nA stake in International Business Machines Corp  declined by nearly $600 million in the quarter to $11.15 billion.\nBerkshire also reported boosting its share stake in Deere & Co and cutting its share stake in AT&T Inc.\nBerkshire also owns roughly 90 businesses including the BNSF railroad, Dairy Queen ice cream, Fruit of the Loom underwear and Geico auto insurance.

That means it has flown 65.6 million passengers in the 12 months to the end of February, up 6.5% from 61.6 million in the previous 12 months and its load factor is up to 90.8%, from 89.4%.\nTraffic at Aer Lingus, measured in revenue passenger kilometres, rose 6.9% in February, while load factor rose 1.9 percentage points to 69.2% as a 0.9% drop in passenger numbers was more than offset by a 3.9% fall in capacity measured in available seat kilometres.\nRevenue passenger kilometres is the preferred measure of traffic for scheduled carriers with both long-haul and short-haul operations as it takes account of passenger numbers and distance flown. Low-cost airlines like easyJet just report passenger numbers. Revenue passengers are those that pay commercial fares, and exclude free staff flights and free children's flights. Revenue passenger kilometres include the kilometres flown, by stages, and is an attempt to measure sales volume.\nAer Lingus short-haul traffic measured in revenue passenger kilometres fell 3.5%, while its smaller long-haul operations rose 27.6%.\nOn Wednesday, International Consolidated Airlines Group PLC, which is trying to buy Aer Lingus, had said its group traffic measured in revenue passenger kilometres rose 5.5% on the year in February, outpacing a 4.3% increase in capacity in available seat kilomtres. Its group premium traffic, its most-profitable traffic, rose 2.8% on the year.\nRevenue passenger kilometres rose 3.3% at British Airways, outpacing a 2.0% rise in available seat kilomtres, rose 10.8% at Iberia, outpacing a 7.9% rise on capacity, while the figure was up 11.6% at Vueling, not enough to outpace a 16.4% increase in available seat kilometres.\nCargo tonne kilometres were down 2.8% at British Airways but rose 2.5% at Iberia.

REUTERS/Mike Segar\nBy Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK\nNEW YORK Major U.S. stock exchanges and Barclays Plc on Wednesday won the dismissal of nationwide litigation in which pension funds and other investors accused them of rigging markets to benefit high-frequency traders.\nU.S. District Judge Jesse Furman in Manhattan said federal law affords exchanges \"absolute immunity\" from the plaintiffs' key claims, including over the creation of \"complex order types\" and proprietary data feeds that can benefit rapid traders, because of their status as self-regulatory organizations.\nIn a 51-page decision, Furman also said the plaintiffs did not show they reasonably relied on Barclays' misrepresentations about the safety of its Barclays LX \"dark pool,\" including that they were not at risk of being exploited by fast traders.\nThe lawsuit accused Barclays and seven exchanges including Nasdaq, Intercontinental Exchange Inc's New York Stock Exchange, BATS Global Markets and CHX Holdings Inc's Chicago Stock Exchange of giving high-frequency traders favoured treatment, costing less-favoured investors billions of dollars.\nSeveral regulators are also investigating dark pools, and New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has sued Barclays.\nHigh-frequency traders use computer algorithms to gain split-second trading advantages, and were accused of rigging markets in Michael Lewis' 2014 best-seller \"Flash Boys.\"\nFurman alluded to Lewis in saying it is for Congress and U.S. authorities such as the Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission to level the playing field for investors, rather than let private plaintiffs do their work.\n\"Lewis and the critics of HFT may be right in arguing that it serves no productive purpose and merely allows certain traders to exploit technological inefficiencies in the markets at the expense of other traders,\" he wrote. \"They may also be right that there is a need for regulatory or other action from the SEC or entities such as the exchanges and Barclays. Those, however, are debates and tasks for others.\"\nPatrick Coughlin, a lawyer representing several pension fund plaintiffs, said: \"We're disappointed that the judge thought the exchanges deserved immunity as to complex order types. The way they were implemented disadvantaged our clients. We will review the opinion and determine whether to appeal.\"\nBarclays said it is pleased with the \"thorough and well-reasoned\" decision. The exchanges declined to comment.\nFurman said one plaintiff, Great Pacific Securities may amend its lawsuit against Barclays, calling it premature to say doing so would be futile.

  "articleText" : "Financials | Tue May 5, 2015 | 11:58am IST\nAberdeen AM posts H1 outflows, says conditions to remain challenging\nLONDON May 5 British asset manager Aberdeen Asset Management posted a 25 percent jump in first-half profits, boosted by a recent acquisition, but also saw more money leave its funds on the back of market uncertainty.\nAberdeen said underlying pretax profit during the six months to the end of March rose to 270.2 million pounds ($409 million), thanks to a 20 percent increase in revenues to 605.2 million pounds.\nThat helped total assets under management rise to 330.6 billion pounds from 325.4 billion in the year-earlier period.\nWhile the firm's funds, boosted by the completion of its acquisition of SWIP from Lloyds Banking Group, chalked up a 13.5 billion pound gain from market performance, clients still pulled out cash totalling 11.3 billion pounds.\nUnderpinning the rush to the exits was concern around the outlook for emerging markets, as investors brace for a potential U.S. rate hike. Aberdeen said it expected uncertainty to continue in the short term.\n\"Headline outflows are disappointing arising from a combination of asset allocation decisions amidst continued weak investor sentiment towards emerging markets and some expected structural outflows from certain institutional clients,\" the company said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\"The potential for global economic and political uncertainty remains and we expect operating conditions to remain challenging in the short term,\" the company added.\nAberdeen said it would pay an interim dividend of 7.5 pence a share, up 11 percent, and return 100 million pounds to shareholders over the rest of the year via share buybacks.

  "articleText" : "Kraft, Cadbury's and Britvic in Total Recall: how pulling a product affects profit\nWhat happens to a company’s share price when it has to recall a product?\nThursday 19 March 2015 17:28 BST\nClick to follow\nThe Independent Online\nAlthough a product recall may affect the public perception of a brand, it does not hurt its prospects with investors Getty Images\nMetal shards in Mac and Cheese, salmonella in Cadbury’s chocolate, horse meat in turkey burgers. These are familiar stories of big companies recalling products because of new – unintended – changes to the recipe.\nKraft is the latest company to make headlines for recalling a product - 6.5 million of them in fact. It asked customers to return 7.25-ounce packets of its hallmark mac and cheese with a best before in September and October this year in the US, Puerto Rico and the Caribbean after metal bits were discovered in the food by eight separate customers.\nKraft's share price closed down two per cent after the announcement but is since back up to trading at prior levels - suggesting investors were barely alarmed by the news.\nHistory seems to show that though product recall may affect the public perception of a brand, it does not hurt its prospects with investors.\nKraft Singles\nMac and Cheese was not the first Kraft product recall. In August it recalled 7,700 cases of some varieties of Kraft American Singles after a supplier failed to store an ingredient correctly. Back then the share price dipped for two days but was back to pre-recall levels less than a month later.\n \nCadbury\nIn 2006 Britain's beloved chocolate-maker Cadbury-Schweppes recalled more that one million chocolate bars after contamination from a leaking pipe at a Cadbury factory resulted in a salmonella outbreak that infected nearly 40 people. That summer, sales of Cadbury's chocolate fell 14 per cent while Cadbury reported the incident would cost them a hefty £20 million in recall costs, advertising and manufacturing improvements.\nFruit Shoot\nBritvic recalled Fruit Shoot, a brand of children's fruit drink, after a six-year-old boy nearly choked on a loose cap in 2012. A week after the incident, Britvic's share price had slumped 13.4 per cent. By the end of the year, the recall cost Britvic £16.8 million.\nSpecial K\nSome cereal-eaters found their Special K had an extra crunch in February 2013 after glass fragments were found in the Kellogg's cereal. The company pulled 36,000 packets from supermarket shelves as a precaution. Kellogg's shares tanked 13 per cent on the day of the announcement but by the time of the company's third quarter results, profits had gone up because of cost cutting measures that could have resulted in the lax factory standards in the first place.\nHorse meat\nIrish food inspectors found traces of horse meat in frozen beefburgers made in the UK and Ireland in mid-January 2013, resulting in Tesco, Asda and Nestle products being recalled, among others. Tesco blamed the scandal for a one per cent drop in sales in May, however shares in Sainsbury's, Morrison's and Tesco all rose between nine and 16 per cent in the following weeks, indicating that investors and customers alike had brushed off the risks.\n",

The U.S. government never sued Halliburton under the Act, one person familiar with the case said.\n\"We have now settled all matters relating to the accident with both our partners in the well and our contractors,\" BP spokesman Geoff Morrell said in an email.\nTransocean said BP would pay the company $125 million in compensation for legal fees it incurred, adding the companies will mutually release all claims against each other.\nThe company added BP will also discontinue its attempts to recover as an \"additional insured\" under Transocean's liability policies that will accelerate the company's recovery of about $538 million in insurance claims.\nTransocean also said it would pay about $212 million to a fund set up to pay out claims to people and businesses harmed by the spill, subject to the approval by U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.\n\"We applaud Transocean for adding to the settlement funds established in the Halliburton settlement to help compensate people and businesses for their losses,\" said co-lead plaintiffs' attorneys, Stephen Herman and James Roy.\nTransocean said it intends to make the payments using cash on hand.\nIn September, a U.S. judge ruled that BP was mostly at fault and that Transocean and Halliburton were not as much to blame.\nHalliburton, which did the cementing work for BP's well, had earlier blamed BP's decision to use only six centralizers for the blowout that spilled millions of barrels of oil for 87 days.\nHalliburton said in September that it reached a $1.1 billion settlement for a majority of claims related to its role in the oil spill.\nLondon-based BP has already taken $43.8 billion in pretax charges for clean-up and other costs.

Analysts had predicted 75 pence, the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Earnings in 2014 were about 66 pence, Pearson said. Analysts estimated 64 pence.\nPearson, which gets more than 90 percent of its revenue from its education division, is reducing costs and expanding to online products as textbook sales are pressured by the popularity of book renting and Internet learning materials. Pearson’s reorganization effort has included about 4,000 job cuts in the two years through 2014.\n“We enter 2015 a simpler, leaner, more cash generative business,” Chief Executive Officer John Fallon said in the statement.\nShares of the company rose 3.6 percent to 1,281 pence at 8:58 a.m. in London. They dropped 11 percent last year.\nBook rentals are gaining popularity in particular in the U.S. higher-education market, Ian Whittaker, a Liberum Capital Ltd. analyst in London, said today in a note. Pearson also faces challenges in the testing and kingergarten-through-12th-grade markets, said Whittaker, who recommends selling the stock.\n“Unlike previous years, there is not a profit warning,” Whittaker said. “We still see the structural pressures in their business intensifying.”\nPearson, which gets about 60 percent of revenue in the U.S., reported a 6 percent decline in nine-month revenue in October and said long-time Chief Financial Officer Robin Freestone will step down this year.\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.\n",

REUTERS/Stephen Hird\nBy Carolyn Cohn | LONDON\nLONDON British insurer Aviva (AV.L) said it was closing the London head office of recently bought Friends Life as it reported rapid progress in integrating the acquisition, a key part of a turnaround led by Chief Executive Mark Wilson.\nAviva announced the agreed 5.6 billion pound ($8.5 billion) Friends acquisition late last year, against a backdrop of UK pension reforms allowing retirees more choice in spending their pension pots, instead of being forced to buy an annuity - a key source of income for the insurance industry.\nWilson, brought in more than two years ago from Asian rival AIA (1299.HK) with the task of restructuring the company, said Aviva's turnaround was ahead of schedule.\n\"This is a satisfactory set of results, in particular our UK businesses have performed well,\" he told reporters on Thursday. \"We have started (the Friends Life) integration at pace.\"\nAviva said it was closing Friends Life's head office in London's main financial district and had moved to smaller premises in Exeter, southwest England. It did not say how many jobs would be lost but has signalled the loss of up to 1,500 jobs in total after the acquisition.\nThe company has said the Friends purchase should generate about 225 million pounds in annual cost savings by the end of 2017. \"We'll be disappointed if we didn't get at least that figure,\" Wilson said.\nAviva, which says the merger creates a UK market leader in life insurance with 16 million customers, also said it saw first-quarter gains in the key measures of its life and general insurance businesses.\nIts value of new business grew 14 percent to 247 million pounds ($376 million) from a year earlier, though the value of new business for annuities fell 60 percent. Its combined operating ratio improved by 1.3 percentage points to 96.4 percent. A number below 100 percent indicates a profit.\nAviva shares, which fell at one stage in the previous session to a near four-month low of 507.5 pence, dipped 0.2 percent to 512.5p by 0832 GMT against a 0.9 percent fall in European insurance stocks .SXIP.\nJP Morgan reiterated its \"buy\" recommendation on the stock, saying Aviva was a \"strong restructuring story with potential for organic growth, post-Friends Life integration\".\nAviva, which completed the Friends Life acquisition after the end of its fiscal first quarter, published separate data for Friends Life, whose value of new business fell 37.5 percent to 20 million pounds.\n(Editing by Sinead Cruise)\n",

A Serious Fraud Office inquiry into the company could last up to seven years.\nThe settlement is subject to confirmation by a federal court in New York. “The agreement, if confirmed, will settle one of two claims before US courts arising out of the commercial income overstatement,” Tesco said .\nThe second claim is being brought in Ohio by holders of ADRs, which Tesco says make up less than 0.2pc of the company’s total shares.\n",

( bit.ly/1F3YltV )\nStifel is hoping to bring on board the unit's 180 advisers, who manage about $56 billion from offices in 12 cities.\nThis compares inauspiciously with the 250-300 advisers that Barclays executives said were working a year ago. A spokesman declined to specify historic numbers.\nDepending on the number of advisers who ultimately join Stifel, the deal could contribute $200-$325 million to revenue, Stifel Chief Executive Ron Kruszewski said on a conference call.\nKruszewski has paid relatively low prices to buy companies in the past, but often provides generous packages to retain their employees.\nIn talking up the complimentary \"entrepreneurial\" cultures of the firms during the call, Kruszewski appeared to be speaking as much to Barclays brokers as to the financial community.\nStifel will be allowed to exclusively sell certain Barclays-underwritten stock and bond offerings to retail investors, a major business of many of the Barclays brokers.\n\"At the mid-point of guidance, it appears this transaction could be double digit percent accretive to 2016 EPS,\" Wells Fargo Securities analyst Christopher Harris wrote in a note, but he added that this depended on adviser retention.\nSt. Louis-based Stifel, a once low-key firm specializing in municipal bonds, is now a national presence serving individual investors and middle-market companies.\nKruszewski, who became CEO in 1997, has bought several, mostly troubled, retail brokerage and investment banking firms since 2005.\nStifel closed the acquisition of Alabama-based Sterne Agee Group for about $150 million on Friday. S&P Capital IQ analyst Ken Leon said Sterne Agee would likely generate $300-$325 million in revenue, raising his target price by $5 to $65.\nSources told Reuters in May that Barclays was reaching out to potential buyers for its U.S. wealth business.\nKruszewski said Stifel would cut costs by combining some back-office operations and closing branches where the firms have duplicate locations.\nStifel said it expected pretax margins of between 20-25 percent after amortization of retention, and that it would issue between 1 million and 2 million shares.\nThe deal is expected to close in November, Stifel said.\nStifel's shares were up 0.7 percent at $57.45 in early afternoon trading.

(ICE) on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) March 1, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n1/2\nleft\nright\nA man walks past the London Stock Exchange in the City of London October 11, 2013. REUTERS/Stefan Wermuth\n2/2\nBy Noor Zainab Hussain , Esha Vaish and John McCrank\nNew York Stock Exchange owner ICE (ICE.N) said it may make a rival bid for London Stock Exchange (LSE.L), raising the prospect of a takeover battle with Deutsche Boerse (DB1Gn.DE) and lifting LSE shares to a record high on Tuesday.\nThe announcement by Intercontinental Exchange Inc is the latest development in a long string of mergers, bidding wars and failed deals among global exchanges.\nThe industry has been trying to consolidate for years amid weaker trading volumes and shrinking margins. Instead of stock trading, the exchanges have focused on more profitable businesses, such as derivatives trading and selling market data.\nBut regulatory concerns about the concentration of power in the hands of a few exchanges, along with nationalist wrangling, have hindered many cross-border deals.\nLSE Chief Executive Xavier Rolet has been one of the most vocal advocates of consolidation. In December he laid out his vision of global exchange consolidation, saying he expected three to five \"exchange powerhouses\" in North America, Europe and Asia.\nWhether ICE will follow through with a bid for LSE is not certain. The Atlanta-based exchange said it had not yet approached LSE and may not pursue a deal at all. Nonetheless, news of its interest pushed up share prices of exchanges across Europe.\nWhile Deutsche Boerse is interested in combining with LSE to create a full-service trading powerhouse, analysts said, ICE's interest likely relates to two of LSE's businesses: Clearing and market data. After acquiring NYSE in 2013, ICE kept the New York Stock Exchange and its mainly European-focused derivatives unit, Liffe, but sold off other substantial parts of NYSE's business.\nICE had attempted in 2010 to buy NYSE together with Nasdaq Inc (NDAQ.O). The two exchanges placed a bid to rival Deutsche Borse's, when the German exchange attempted to buy the Big Board. Regulatory concerns ultimately foiled both Deutsche Borse's and Nasdaq's attempts.\nThose concerns still carry relevance today.\nLSE and Deutsche Boerse are already walking a political tight-rope between London and Frankfurt as they hammer out terms of their agreed merger. Political and regulatory demands may be even more strenuous if a non-European exchange tries to buy LSE.\nCME Group (CME.O) is actively considering doing so, people familiar with the matter said. Analysts suggested that Euronext NV (ENX.PA) and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (0388.HK) may also be interested. All three declined to comment.\n\"It's going to force anybody that has been potentially looking at (LSE) to step up or go away,\" said Numis Securities analyst Jonathan Goslin.\nA RICHER OFFER?\nThe proposed tie-up of Deutsche Boerse and LSE, which was announced last week, would be an all-stock merger. It would give  Deutsche Boerse shareholders a 54.4 percent stake in the new company. However, rival bidders could force Deutsche Boerse to offer a bigger premium or bow out.\nDeutsche Boerse said it had seen ICE's statement but indicated it was not looking to alter its proposed offer, while LSE confirmed it had not received a proposal from ICE.     \"The company is continuing its merger talks with LSE with no change,\" Deutsche Boerse said in a statement.\nSources familiar with the proposed tie-up said the pair are betting that they stand a stronger chance of winning approval from European governments and regulators, than if a U.S. operator were involved.\n\"Deutsche Boerse and LSE are banking on political backing from Brussels, Berlin and probably also London for a 'European deal' that might support the planned EU capital markets union,\" one source said.\nThe source said Rolet still has faith in the Deutsche Boerse deal, even if a rival comes through with a richer offer, although analysts said an all-cash deal would be difficult to turn down.\n\"Our suspicion is that ICE or CME will derail the Deutsche-Boerse-LSE love affair only by offering cash,\" independent research firm AlphaValue said in a note to clients.\nShares of LSE, which had a market value of $13 billion at Monday's close, rose as much as 9 percent to 2,918 pence.\nICE shares were down about 3 percent at $231.26 in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while shares of CME Group Inc (CME.O) were up 1 percent at $92.38 on the Nasdaq.\nThe German company's shares ended regular trading at 76.87 euros, up 0.9 percent.\nICE must make an offer for LSE no later than March 29. Under British takeover rules, Deutsche Boerse must either make a formal offer or announce it will not do so by March 22, unless it gets an extension from the UK mergers regulator. Rolet plans to retire if LSE's planned merger with its German rival goes ahead.\n(Additional reporting by Jonathan Gould and Andreas Kroener in Frankfurt and Anjuli Davies in London; Writing by Rachel Armstrong and Lauren Tara LaCapra; Editing by Savio D'Souza, Alexander Smith and Steve Orlofsky)\nNext In Deals\n",

REUTERS/Rafael Marchante\n2/2\nVon By Jose Elías Rodríguez | MADRID\nMADRID Spain's Caixabank (CABK.MC) said on Monday it was making a fresh takeover offer worth around $1 billion (704.97 million pounds) for the 56 percent of Portuguese lender Banco BPI (BBPI.LS) that it does not already own, after a key obstacle was removed on Sunday.\nThe offer, of 1.113 euros per share, is conditional on the Portuguese bank eliminating a 20 percent cap on any one shareholder's voting rights, the Spanish bank said in a statement to the stock market regulator.\nPortugal's government approved a measure late on Sunday to end such shareholder voting limits at its banks, helping clear the way for the offer.\nBefore that was passed, the shareholder limit prevented Caixabank from being able to use the full weight of its 44 percent stake in BPI in overcoming Angolan billionaire investor Isabel dos Santos's resistance to Caixabank taking over BPI and detaching its majority-owned Angolan bank, BFA.\nWith Caixabank's voting rights limited to 20 percent, the lender's influence at BPI was little more than that of dos Santos, the daughter of Angola's president who owns 18.6 percent through Lisbon-based holding company Santoro Finance.\nCaixabank and Santoro are BPI's two largest shareholders and the Spanish bank has been trying to buy dos Santos out and gain full control of BPI for at least a year.\nOn Sunday BPI announced the collapse of a deal agreed earlier this month for Caixabank to at last buy out Dos Santos and at the same time reduce its exposure to BFA by selling down its stake to Dos Santos.\nBPI owns 50.1 percent of BFA while Unitel, the Angolan telecom firm dos Santos controls jointly with state oil company Sonangol, holds 49.9 percent, but new European banking rules took effect this month which required BPI to make full provision for BFA's lending risks or else face daily fines.\nSantoro said in a statement on Saturday that under the deal dos Santos had wanted BFA's shares to be listed in Lisbon, something Portuguese regulators opposed.\n\"For Caixabank we believe the acquisition would be neutral taking into account that BPI only represents 12 percent of total assets, although we believe the final bid removes the risk of the Spanish bank increasing the bid price in an attempt to convince dos Santos,\" Haitong Research said in an investor note.\nTrading in BPI has been suspended since April 8, when the shares closed at 1.191 euros (0.9489 pounds). Caixabank's shares were down 3 percent at 2.598 euros per share by 0844 GMT on Monday.\nCaixabank expects the acquisition, which it hopes to close by the end of the third quarter, to hit its core capital solvency ratio by between 0.97 and 1.46 percentage points, depending on acceptance levels.\nThe lender reiterated it maintained a full-loaded core capital ratio goal of over 11 percent of assets following the buyout, in line with its 2015-2018 strategic plans\nThe Spanish bank said it saw annual cost synergies from the deal of around 85 million euros by the third year and revenue synergies of 35 million euros per year. It estimated restructuring costs of around 250 million euros.\n(This version of the story refiles share price to transpose paragraphs 5 and 6)\n(Additional reporting and writing by Paul Day; Editing by Greg Mahlich)\nNÄCHSTEN ARTIKEL\n",

  "articleText" : "Former Aviva Investors analyst fined and banned for 'cherry-picking' trades\nFCA has punished Mothahir Miah nine months after fining the insurance group £17.6m\nAviva Investors manages £246bn of assets for both external clients and its own business Photo: PA\nBy Marion Dakers , Financial services editor\n2:39PM GMT 17 Nov 2015\nFollow\nA former analyst at Aviva Investors who “cherry-picked” his best trades for the clients who paid the most commission has been fined and banned from the City for at least five years.\nThe Financial Conduct Authority said that Mothahir Miah must pay a £139,000 penalty for “failing to act with honest and integrity” over a period of more than two years until October 2012.\nAviva Investors was fined £17.6m in February for its role in the dishonest trades, and the firm has also paid “significant compensation” to the clients who were affected.\nThe FCA said Mr Miah would delay booking his trades during the day, before allocating the best-performing positions to hedge fund clients that generated the biggest fees for him. This tactic meant his other clients, such as long-only funds, which paid lower or no commissions, would miss out on his most profitable deals.\nHe was supposed to book trades to specific clients within 15 minutes, but instead would often email the details to the record-keepers hours afterwards, after waiting to see how lucrative the trade was.\n“Mr Miah knew that cherry picking was wrong, but was motivated by a desire to prove his trading ability to his colleagues and increase his prospects of being promoted,” said the regulator. “This is because the culture within the Fixed Income business was heavily focused on performance and promotions tended to be based on reported investment performance.”\nThe FCA said that Mr Miah’s early admissions and expression of remorse meant that he could apply to have his ban from financial services work lifted after five years.\nAviva Investors did not comment on the fine, but said at the time of its own regulatory settlement that it had “made significant improvements to its governance and control framework”.\nAfter Aviva uncovered the practices in its fixed income team, it paid £132m into eight funds to ensure that their performance was not damaged and no customers lost money as a result. The company also brought in PwC last year to review its internal control processes.\n",

REUTERS/Robert Galbraith\nBy Paul Sandle | LONDON\nLONDON Britain's ARM Holdings ARM.L said more than half of all smartphones shipped in the fourth quarter contained its most powerful processor technology, helping it grow revenue even as demand cools in markets such as China.\nThe company's v8 architecture, which analysts say commands 30 percent higher royalties than its forerunner, has filtered down from devices like Apple's (AAPL.O) iPhone at the beginning of the year to become the industry standard.\nChief Financial Officer Chris Kennedy said that a 14 percent rise in revenue in the fourth quarter, ahead of expectations, was driven by strong royalties.\nProcessor royalty revenues rose 24 percent, defying a 3 percent drop in industry revenue for chips in smartphones, although they were boosted by a $9 million late payment.\n\"We expect chips based on our latest version 8 technology will continue to replace older ARM technology in mobile markets, and gain share in networking infrastructure and servers,\" Kennedy said.\n\"It will end up in every phone, even down in the low end.\"\nARM reported a 17 percent rise in pretax profit to 138.7 million pounds on revenue, measured in dollars, up 14 percent to $407.9 million, for the three months to end-December.\nKennedy said based on current market conditions revenues for 2016 would be \"broadly in line\" with expectations, which stand at about $1.64 billion.\nShares in the company fell 5 percent to 893.5 pence in early deals, as analysts at Liberum said adjusted earnings had just missed forecasts, once the one-off royalty catch-up payment was excluded.\nThey also said that the outlook sounded a note of caution. \"ARM does not typically use the word broadly,\" they said.\nSome of ARM's biggest customers have raised concerns about demand in China.\nApple, which analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate provides about 5 percent of ARM's revenue, forecast its first revenue drop in 13 years last month as the Chinese market showed signs of weakening.\n\"Clearly China is an issue for businesses globally,\" Kennedy said. \"For ARM, given our diversification, it's something we focus on but it's not something we are overly worried about.\"\n(Editing by Kate Holton and Louise Heavens)\nNext In Technology News\n",

They are retained as a corporation's trusted adviser, built up over years of being its eyes and ears in the market.\nMorgan Stanley and UBS are currently corporate brokers to RBS. The new broking role will likely include larger responsibilites to help the bank through the privatisation process. UBS, which already advises the government on a number of selloffs in process, will likely not pitch for the expanded role.\nMorgan Stanley has also been advising UK Financial Investments (UKFI), which manages government stakes in RBS and Lloyds along with other financial assets, on its plan to sell shares in Lloyds since December.\nJPMorgan is among a group of banks pitching for the new role at RBS, sources said.  The bank was until recently adviser to UKFI, which British finance minister George Osborne said on May 22 would merge with the Shareholder Executive, which controls 23 other state-owned businesses, and is itself looking for new advisers as part of a planned rotation.\nIn a speech to business leaders in London, Osborne said he wanted to \"get the government out of the business of owning great chunks of our banking system, and indeed other assets that should be in the private sector\".\nIn March, the government said it wanted to sell 9 billion pounds of shares in Lloyds and 13 billion pounds of home loans held by bailed-out Northern Rock and Bradford and Bingley by the end of the 2015/16 financial year.\nRBS, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, UBS and UKFI declined comment.

  "articleText" : "Add Your Note (Optional):\n \nLONDON (Alliance News) - Kingfisher's attempt to expand its French business by acquiring Mr Bricolage has run into trouble almost a year after it was first mooted, with its rival's board and a major Mr Bricolage shareholder apparently holding reservations about a deal.\nThe French company's shares were suspended in Paris on Monday pending a statement. On Tuesday, Kingfisher shed some light on the development, saying it had been made aware that the board of Mr Bricolage and ANPF, a major shareholder in the French company, have reservations in relation to the acquisition, though Kingfisher said it has not yet received any clarification of their position.\nThe Tabur family, another major shareholder in Kingfisher, has confirmed it remains in favour of the deal, Kingfisher said.\nKingfisher went into exclusive negotiations in April last year to acquire Mr Bricolage for EUR275 million. Under the terms of the proposed deal, it was to acquire a 41.9% stake from from ANPF, which is held by franchisees, and 26.2% from the Tabur Family, at an agreed price per share of EUR15. It would then make a mandatory offer to the minority shareholders. The deal also faced anti-trust scrutiny as Kingfisher already has sizeable French operations of its own.\nThe owner of DIY chains like B&Q and Screwfix currently has Brico Dépôt and Castorama stores in France. Its sales in France declined 9.3% in the third quarter of its recently-ended financial year, while profit in the country fell to GBP120 million, from GBP140 million a year earlier. It blamed the weak French economy for the decline.\nMeanwhile, the price deflation affecting retailers in the UK was one of the factors behind a drop in UK consumer price inflation to zero for the first time on record in February. Data from the Office for National Statistics showed that consumer prices remained flat in February from last year after rising 0.3% in January. Economists had expected prices to rise 0.1%.\nThe news weighed on the pound, which fell against other major currency pairs as the data suggested the Bank of England won't raise interest rates for some time to come.\n----------\nMarkets: The FTSE 100 has traded both sides of unchanged, reversing an early fall to set a new record intraday high of 7,065.08. The pound is down against the dollar after UK inflation fell to zero for the first time on record in February.\nUS stock futures point to a slightly higher open, with the DJIA, S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 all set to open up 0.2%.\nFTSE 100: flat at 7,039.14\nFTSE 250: up 0.2% at 17,592.02\nAIM ALL-SHARE: up 0.6% at 720.67\nGBP-USD: down at 1.4930\nGOLD: up at USD1,192.75 an ounce\nOIL (Brent): up at USD55.86 a barrel\n----------\nOther Top Corporate News\n----------\nWolseley said its pretax profit fell by two-thirds in the first half of the financial year, as it booked a large impairment due to challenging market conditions in the Nordic region, but its closely-watched trading profit rose on the back of a strong performance in the US, by far its biggest market. The building materials company reported a pretax profit of GBP103 million for the six months to end-January, down from GBP312 million a year earlier, as it booked a GBP245 million impairment for the DT Group business in the Nordics it bought back in 2006. It blamed challenging market conditions in the region and reduced expectations of future profitability at the business. Still, Wolseley raised its interim dividend to 30.25 pence, from 27.50 pence a year earlier, on the back of a 13.3% increase in its headline earnings per share, a figure that strips out exceptional items and impairments. Its trading profit from ongoing businesses rose 11% to GBP390 million, from GBP351 million, as revenue rose 8.9% to GBP6.44 billion from GBP5.91 billion and its trading margin rose 20 basis points to 6.1%..\n----------\nLand Securities Group said it has exchange contracts for the sale of its 95% stake in Times Square in the City of London for GBP268.4 million. The FTSE 100-listed property company is selling the 380,000 square foot office building to real estate funds managed by US private equity group The Blackstone Group LP.\n----------\nHSBC Holdings said it will issue USD2.25 billion of 6.375% perpetual subordinated contingent convertible bonds, with the proceeds to be used to strengthen its capital position and for general corporate purposes. Contingent convertible securities, known as cocos, are being used by banks to bolster their capital ratios to meet tougher regulatory requirements following the financial crisis of 2007-09. HSBC has previously issued EUR1.50 billion of 5.25% cocos, USD2.25 billion of 6.375% cocos, and USD1.50 billion of 5.625% cocos. HSBC said the bonds, which have no fixed maturity date, are callable in March 2025 and every five years beyond that point, with interest payments to be paid semi-annually.\n----------\nBritish American Tobacco appointed KPMG LLP as its new external auditor, replacing PricewaterhouseCoopers which had been the company's auditor since it listed in 1998. The switch is the latest amongst a rash of auditor changes by London-listed companies, after the UK anti-trust regulator and the European Commission put in new rules in the wake of the financial crisis requiring companies in the FTSE 350 to re-tender for auditing business every 10 years. BAT said PwC has resigned with immediate effect, with KPMG taking over for 2015. The switch will need to be approved by BAT shareholders at its Annual General Meeting on April 29.\n----------\nSpire Healthcare Group has guided mid-to-high single-digit revenue growth for 2015, as it posted a narrowed pretax loss for 2014 on strong revenue growth in its first results since listing on the London Stock Exchange last July. The independent hospital group proposed a maiden final dividend of 1.8 pence, and said that, as it detailed at the time of its IPO last July, it plans to adopt a progressive dividend policy based on a payout ratio of around 20% of pretax profit. Spire posted a pretax loss of GBP7.0 million in 2014, narrowed from a pretax loss of GBP51.9 million in 2013, as a rise in revenue to GBP856.0 million from GBP764.5 million helped offset GBP54.0 million in exceptional costs primarily relating to its listing and GBP85.9 million in finance costs including interest on loans and bank facilities.\n----------\nAG Barr reported higher pretax profit and revenue for its last financial year, as its key IRN-BRU, Barr, Rubicon and Strathmore brands all grew and outperformed the broader market, particularly the Strathmore water brand. The soft drinks manufacturer said pretax profit rose to GBP38.6 million, compared with GBP34.3 million a year earlier, as revenue rose to GBP260.9 million, from GBP254.1 million, and margins increased as it cut overheads, improved its supply chain and as input costs fell. It closely-watched pretax profit excluding exceptional items rose to GBP41.9 million from GBP38.1 million. It will pay a final dividend of 9.01 pence per share, up from 8.19 pence a year before, bringing the total dividend for the year to 12.12p, up 10% on the year.\n----------\n888 Holdings reported strong growth in pretax profit and revenue in 2014, driven by the continued growth of its casino, poker and sport products, but its first-quarter is already showing a hit from tax changes in various jurisdictions. The online gaming provider said pretax profit rose 28% to USD68 million in 2014, from USD53 million in 2013, as revenue increased 14% to USD455 million from USD401 million, and margins increased. It said it will pay a final dividend of 4.5 cents per share compared with 4.0 cents the year before, bringing the total dividend for the year to 15 cents per share. However, the company said average daily revenue during the first quarter of the current financial year was 6% lower than the previous year, but was up 7% on a constant currency basis excluding VAT.\n----------\nGAME Digital reported lower profits and revenue for the first half of its financial year, after it was hit by difficult trading over the key Christmas period, and it also warned that 2015 has got off to a slower start than it had expected although it's hoping for a pickup in coming weeks. It sweetened the news by declaring a maiden interim dividend of 7.35 pence a share and a special dividend of 14.7 pence, or GBP25 million, a move it said reflected its longer-term prospects and a strong cash position. The video game and console retailer reported a pretax profit of GBP33.2 million for the 26 weeks to January 24, down from GBP33.8 million a year earlier, as revenue slipped to GBP582.1 million from GBP586.4 million.\n----------\nAIM Movers\n----------\nInspired Energy shares are up after it reported a big rise in pretax profit and revenue for 2014 on the back of massive growth in its small and medium-sized enterprise division, and it raised its dividend. Pinnacle Technology Group is up after it signed a partnership with O2, the UK mobile arm of Spanish telecoms company Telefonica SA, that allows Pinnacle to provide O2's mobile, digital and accredited public sector services to its clients. Augean is another gainer after its pretax profit rose in 2014, driven by a 26% rise in revenue as all five of its divisions grew. It also reported more long-term contracts, providing greater visibility in its order book, and hiked its dividend by nearly half. GETECH Group is also up after it reported higher pretax profit and revenue for the first half of its financial year and said it has struck a deal to buy upstream oil and gas consultancy ERCL. Fusionex International is up after it secured a further contract for its GIANT platform via a Smart Government Initiative in Asia. eServGlobal's AIM-listed shares are down after shareholders rejected its remuneration report at an annual general meeting in Sydney and the company said it's trading in line with its expectations so far in the current financial year.\n----------\nOther Top Economics And General\n----------\nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron has ruled out going on to stand for a third term if he gets elected for a second five-year term at the general election in May. Conservative leader Cameron, who has led a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats through the last five years, told the BBC that he wants to be re-elected for the next five years so that he can finish the job of implementing reforms and improving the economy. \"I feel I've got more to bring to this job, I feel the job is half done. The economy is turned round and the deficit is halved down and I want to finish the job. I want to go on with the education reforms and the welfare reforms,\" he told the BBC.\n----------\nThe Eurozone private sector grew at the fastest pace in almost four years in March, flash data from Markit Economics showed. The flash composite PMI rose more-than-expected to 54.1 in March from 53.3 in February. The index rose for the fourth consecutive month to reach the highest since May 2011. The reading stayed above the forecast of 53.6. At 53.3, the average PMI reading for the first quarter was the highest since the second quarter of last year.\n----------\nGreece will present a list of economic reforms to its eurozone partners by Monday, a government spokesman said. \"We will present the reforms at the latest by Monday,\" Gabriel Sakellaridis told private Mega television. The proposed reforms will not include measures that hamper growth, Sakellaridis said, adding that the measures will be structural. There was no apparent sign of a breakthrough on the reforms that Greece must present to secure the release of bailout funds after a meeting on Monday in Berlin between Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and Chancellor Angela Merkel.\n----------\nThe manufacturing sector in China moved into contraction in March, the latest survey from HSBC Bank showed, with a PMI score of 49.2. That was well shy of forecasts for 50.5, and it was down sharply from 50.7 in February. Now at an 11-month low, the index also dipped below the boom-or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction. \"The HSBC Flash China Manufacturing PMI signalled a slight deterioration in the health of China's manufacturing sector in March. A renewed fall in total new business contributed to a weaker expansion of output, while companies continued to trim their workforce numbers,\" said Markit economist Annabel Fiddes.\n----------\nThe manufacturing sector in Japan was barely in expansion in March, the latest survey from Markit Economics revealed, with a PMI score of 50.4. That was well shy of forecasts for 52.0, and it was down from 51.6 in February. It was also the lowest reading since October.\n----------\nDeveloping Asia will see steady growth this year and next year, underpinned by soft commodity prices and recovery in major industrial economies, the Asian Development Bank said. China's growth is expected to moderate as the economy adjusts to a new normal, while pick-ups in India and other Southeast Asian nations are set to balance the deceleration in China, the Manila-based lender said in a report. The annual economic publication named Asian Development Outlook 2015 predicted 6.3% growth for developing Asia in 2015 as well as 2016. The region expanded 6.3% in 2014.\nIn December, the ADB had estimated 6.1% growth for 2014 and forecast 6.2% for 2015.\n----------\nChina's economic growth could ease further in the first quarter of this year from a five-year low logged in the final three months of 2014, a top government think-tank predicted this week.

In April, the grocer revealed a staggering £6.4bn loss – the biggest ever for a UK retailer, driven largely by property writedowns.\nThe latest figures revealed operating profits for the six months to 29 August sank 55 per cent to £354m. Sales at stores open more than a year fell 1 per cent in the last quarter, and Tesco is paying no dividend. Profits from the UK and Ireland – the main business accounting for three-quarters of its £23.9bn sales – tumbled 70 per cent to £166m. \nMr Lewis admitted that “it takes a long time to rebuild a brand”, but said there were “encouraging signs” from his early efforts to put more staff in stores and improve service, although the wider market remained “challenging”. The average Tesco shopping basket of £48 is more than £1.50 cheaper than a year ago, presenting a headwind to reclaiming sales growth.\nBut despite the lower price environment, the number of transactions in UK stores rose 1.5 per cent, with sales volumes up 1.4 per cent, in a sign that shoppers are returning to the stores.\nRead more\n",

British Gas announced a similar move last summer and last week E.ON said it would reduce prices by 5.1 per cent from 1 February.\nCritics pointed out that delaying its own cut until almost April would boost SSE’s profits by an estimated £24m, while meaning that customers do not benefit until winter is over.\nThe move also reignited widescale complaints that the big six have been overcharging families against a backdrop of falling wholesale energy prices, down 23 per cent last year. \nWill Morris, the managing director of retail at SSE, defended the small decrease. “Wholesale energy prices account for an ever-smaller proportion of the bill and there are different cost issues affecting electricity and gas,” he said. SSE claims the cut will give save customers £32 a year on their bills.\nThe Energy Secretary, Amber Rudd, gave the reduction a cautious welcome. “The market must provide a fair deal for consumers and that’s why I’ve been pressing energy companies to put their customers first and pass on savings to them,” she said. “SSE has taken a step in the right direction.”\nThe other big companies – EDF, Npower and ScottishPower – are almost certain to follow with similar announcements soon, with none expected to break ranks and offer deeper price reductions to customers. \nSSE also revealed that 300,000 of its gas and electricity customers in the UK and Ireland had switched to other suppliers in the past year, taking its total down to 8.28 million. Like the rest of the big six, it has been hit by the rise of independent suppliers, which now hold 15 per cent of the market. \nMore about:\n",

  "articleText" : "No pressure to develop new supply projects: Woodside\nLNG market will re-emerge as excess supply absorbed: Chevron\nShare on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp\nThe over-supplied LNG market is in hiatus as energy giants from Chevron Corp. to Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Woodside Petroleum Corp. await a surge of demand from countries seeking access to energy.\nLiquefied natural gas producers are in “pause mode” as low prices have stalled development of new projects, Woodside Chief Executive Officer Peter Coleman said today at the LNG18 conference in Perth. That respite means that coming years demand will exceed supply, causing prices to rise back to higher levels, Shell CEO Ben Van Beurden said.\nThe price cycle underscores difficulties in timing the construction of multi-billion dollar projects that take years to come online. Companies have to focus on long-term natural gas demand which is expected to grow by 35 percent over the next 20 years, Chevron CEO John Watson said.\n“There is LNG that’s coming on line and it’s clear that there is some surplus. Customers are doing what you would expect them to do, they are going to take advantage of that in the short term,” Watson said. “Once you see that surplus absorbed, you will see that market re-emerge.”\nNo Pressure\nSpot prices for LNG in Singapore fell below $4 per million British thermal units on Monday, according to Singapore Exchange Ltd. That’s the lowest level since the exchange began tracking it in September 2014. It’s plunged from $14 in October 2014.\nAs oil prices slid about 60 percent since mid-2014, more than $400 billion of proposed energy projects have been delayed until 2017 and beyond, according to consulting firm Wood Mackenzie Ltd. Woodside and partners Shell and BP Plc in March scrapped plans to develop the $40 billion Browse liquefied natural gas project in Australia after the plunge in energy prices.\n“We are not under the pressure of having to develop at the moment,” Coleman said. “Industry is in this hiatus, in this pause mode where there is really no market to sell into, so it gives us a chance to step back and say what is the best way to move.”\nDemand Optimism\nThe market could see a deficit of 75 million metric tons of LNG per year by 2025, which would require $250 billion in investment through 2020, Sanford C. Bernstein estimated in November. The market is well-supplied to 2018 and possibly to the end of the decade, it said. Annual demand in Asia-Pacific may gain 36 percent to 245 million tons by 2025, Western Australia’s Premier Colin Barnett said today.\n“The industry may be cyclical and sometimes volatile, but the long term growth trend is undeniable,” Barnett said. Woodside may decide to develop Browse within the next three-to-five years, he said later to reporters. “I am very optimistic about the demand for gas, so I have no doubt Browse will go ahead.”\nDemand is also coming from new markets including Thailand, Pakistan and Poland, Shell said. Australia may increase LNG sales to Europe as the continent struggles with security of supply via pipelines, Barnett said.\nNew Customers\nOil and LNG prices have historically been linked because traditional long-term contracts priced the gas in relation to crude. Brent oil has surged more than 50 percent since hitting a 12-year low in January amid the worst energy crash in a generation. The global benchmark on Tuesday rose as much as 2.7 percent to $44 a barrel.\nMeanwhile, LNG has fallen 28 percent in the same period. Shell expects most LNG to continue on the long-term model based on a mixture of oil and natural gas indices. Short-term prices will be volatile, Van Beurden said.\n“Shorter term LNG will go through different pricing environments,” he said. “At the moment there is a bit more depth, a bit more room in the market, so short-term prices are probably a little bit discounted. When we see that shortness disappear, and the market goes tight again, it will price above the long-term.”\nLow prices represent an opportunity to hook new customers on the product, said Hamad Mubarak Al Muhannadi, chief executive officer for RasGas Co. of Qatar, the world’s biggest LNG-producing country. Lower oil prices and increased LNG production has already eliminated regional price differences that meant Asian buyers traditionally payed more than those in Europe or the Americas, he said.\n“For us, creating new customers and new markets is the issue,” Al Muhannadi said. “This is definitely going to create more demand.\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

But it's going to take another year or two or three, rather than another month or two or three I'm afraid,\" he said.\nSUCCESSIVE QUARTERS OF SALES GROWTH\nTesco said sales at stores in its home market which have been open more than a year rose 0.3 percent in the 13 weeks to May 28, the first quarter of its current financial year.\nThat compared with analysts' forecasts of flat to up 0.5 percent and built on growth of 0.9 percent in the previous quarter.\nIt was the first time Tesco has reported successive quarters of UK underlying sales growth in more than five years and was boosted by a strong customer response to the March launch of seven new exclusive fresh food brands.\nDespite its problems, Tesco remains the biggest supermarket chain in Britain with a market share of more than 28 percent.\nIts shares rose up to 4.4 percent on Thursday but were flat at 166.6 pence by 1455 GMT.\n\"We believe Tesco will be a long-term economic winner but short term we have some concerns on Asda's next move (on prices),\" HSBC analyst David McCarthy said.\nCOFFEE OFF THE MENU\nOn Thursday Tesco said it had agreed the sale of its Harris + Hoole coffee shop business to Caffè Nero for an undisclosed sum.\nLewis has also cut thousands of jobs and sold businesses in South Korea and Turkey as well as the Giraffe restaurant chain and Dobbies Garden centers, as he looks to simplify the company, cut debt and rid Tesco of its junk credit rating.\nLewis said no more asset sales were planned.\nGroup like-for-like sales grew 0.9 percent, boosted by a 3.0 percent increase in international sales.\nAnalysts' profit forecasts for 2016-17 came down in April after Tesco warned that profit growth would be harder to deliver this year than last, given an industry price war.\nFinance chief Alan Stewart said Tesco was comfortable with analysts' current consensus of 1.175 billion pounds ($1.74 billion), up from 944 million pounds in 2015-16.\nAllan said the resumption of dividend payments was \"very much in our minds\", though he could not put a date on it.\nTesco has not paid a dividend since the first half of its 2014-15 year.\n(Editing by Mark Potter, Keith Weir and Jane Merriman)\nNext In Big Story 10\n",

Associated British Foods advised that \"we expect a bigger translation benefit in the final quarter with no material transactional effect at current rates.\"\nAssociated British Foods added that \"our outlook for this financial year has improved and we no longer expect a decline in adjusted earnings per share for the group for the full year.\"\nThe retailer sourced around half of total profits from overseas last year. And with the pound continuing to plummet, the situation is looking rosier for Associated British Foods.\nOn top of this, while much of the retail sector could come under pressure from a cooling UK economy, footfall at Primark could ignite as shoppers flock towards low-price clothes.\nOn paper, Associated British Foods may appear expensive, the firm dealing on a forward\nP/E\nrating of 26.7 times. But I reckon hefty upgrades to earnings forecasts could be just around the corner.\nWithdrawal symptoms\nProperty play Great Portland Estates (LSE:GPOR) also carried higher on Thursday, the firm 3% higher as I write. But this isn't to say the jitters surrounding the commercial property sector won't send the stock price sinking again.\nGreat Portland warned that \"it is likely that the uncertainty created by the EU referendum result will have a negative impact on economic growth in London,\" with firms deferring investment decisions as Britain negotiates its exit from the Union.\nConsequently, Great Portland noted that \"we can expect London's commercial property markets to weaken during this period of uncertainty with the benefits of lower bond yields and weaker sterling offset by reduced rental growth prospects.\"\nWith concerns looming over a protracted and unfavourable exit period, not to mention the possibility of a severe British recession, Great Portland could find itself under significant pressure in the months and years ahead. And I reckon a forward P/E rating of 43.2 times fails to account for these risks.\nSales sliding\nFurniture flogger Dunelm Group (LSE:DNLM) completed the set with a 0.4% share value advance on Thursday.\nThe retailer advised of \"volatile trading through [Q4] driven by changeable weather conditions and a general retail slowdown prior to the EU referendum.\" Like-for-like sales at Dunelm dipped 0.6% during the 13 weeks to 2 July, it announced, continuing the steady decline witnessed in recent quarters.\nAnd things could get a lot more difficult as shoppers put off purchases of non-essential goods. Indeed, Dunelm commented that \"the current uncertainty makes the future trajectory of the economy and consumer confidence unclear.\"\nAs such, I reckon cautious investors should sit on the sidelines for the time being, particularly as Dunelm's forward P/E rating of 15.9 times can hardly be considered unmissable value.\nRoyston Wild has no position in any shares mentioned.

  "articleText" : "Deals | Mon Dec 14, 2015 | 9:46am EST\nAstraZeneca chases Acerta to secure next cancer drug winner\nA sign is seen at an AstraZeneca site in Macclesfield, central England May 19, 2014. REUTERS/Phil Noble\nBy Ben Hirschler | LONDON\nLONDON AstraZeneca said on Monday it was in talks that might lead to the acquisition of privately held biotech firm Acerta Pharma, a potential $5 billion-plus deal designed to build up its cancer drug portfolio.\n\"AstraZeneca confirms that it is exploring potential strategic options with Acerta Pharma BV. There can be no certainty that any transaction will ultimately be entered into, or as to the terms of any transaction,\" it said in a brief statement.\nCredit Suisse analysts said acalabrutinib's considerable potential could also encourage other potential buyers. \"If Acerta is open to a transaction, we would expect significant interest from multiple other bidders,\" they said in a note.\nThe Wall Street Journal had reported on Friday that the British drugmaker was looking to buy Acerta for more than $5 billion to gain access to its experimental blood cancer drug acalabrutinib.\nAcalabrutinib works in a similar way to Imbruvica, which was developed by Pharmacyclics but is now controlled by AbbVie after the U.S. drugmaker bought Pharmacyclics for $21 billion earlier this year. Johnson & Johnson jointly markets Imbruvica.\nBoth drugs are so-called Burton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors that target an array of blood cancers and have the potential to become multibillion-dollar-a-year sellers, according to industry analysts. They may also help in autoimmune diseases like lupus.\nGiven pharmaceutical companies' current heated interest in oncology, Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said it was not surprising that Acerta, based in California and the Netherlands, was an acquisition candidate.\nPIPELINE BOOST\nAcerta does not yet have a partner to help develop its leading drug, although it has agreed to test acalabrutinib in combination with Merck's Keytruda.\nAcerta is running a wide range of cancer clinical trials, including two final-stage Phase III studies. Last week it reported positive results in leukemia.\nThe decision to chase after Acerta reflects a determination by AstraZeneca Chief Executive Pascal Soriot to use deals to boost his company's pipeline as sales of older blockbusters, including cholesterol fighter Crestor, lose patent protection.\nLast month he agreed to buy ZS Pharma, a specialist in treating high potassium levels, for $2.7 billion.\nThe biggest hopes are pinned on oncology, however, where AstraZeneca already has a goal of bringing six new cancer treatments to market by 2020.\nIts new lung cancer pill Tagrisso, which it believes could sell $3 billion a year, was approved last month and the company also recently launched Lynparza for ovarian cancer.\nBuying Acerta would take AstraZeneca into the less familiar territory of blood cancers and some analysts said the move suggested a bigger commitment to this area of oncology than initially expected.\nEarlier this year AstraZeneca signed a deal to co-develop another cancer drug, durvalumab, in blood cancers with Celgene because it said at the time it had limited experience in the field.\n(Editing by Mark Potter and Keith Weir)\nNext In Deals\n",

REUTERS/Luke MacGregor\nBy Carolyn Cohn | LONDON\nLONDON Insurer Prudential Plc (PRU.L) posted a slightly better than forecast capital level under Europe's new Solvency II rules and named John Foley as permanent head of its core UK business on Tuesday, boosting the shares ahead of a meeting with analysts and investors in London.\nPrudential has been a darling of investors but worries about Asian markets, where it is aiming to expand, have hit its share price in recent months.\nChief Executive Mike Wells said on Tuesday the firm was \"continuing to make good progress\" towards its Asia-focused 2017 financial objectives.\n\"We have an operating model that's not dependent on any one market, any one product, any one element of macro-economics, interest rates, equity performance, volatility,\" Wells said at the firm's investor day presentation in London.\nThe company also said it had appointed John Foley as chief executive of Prudential UK & Europe and as an executive director. Foley was appointed interim chief executive of the unit in October, replacing Jackie Hunt.\nHunt resigned a few months after Mike Wells took over as group chief executive from Tidjane Thiam, who left to run Credit Suisse CSGN.VX.\nPrudential is the first British insurer to report its capital levels under the Solvency II rules for EU insurers which took effect this month.\nPrudential's solvency capital ratio was 190 percent of the minimum requirement at end-June, 2015 before allowing for the 2015 interim dividend, it said. Analysts had expected a ratio of at least 180 percent.\nA ratio of 100 percent or more shows insurers have sufficient capital to cover underwriting, investment and operational risks.\n\"The estimated ... capital level of 190 percent will be taken positively and remove any concerns on capital,\" Barclays analysts said in a note to clients.\nSolvency II would not affect the way Prudential calculates its dividend, Chief Financial Officer Nic Nicandrou told the investors and analysts.\nHowever, he also said the high capital costs of UK annuities meant Prudential was likely to reduce its volume of business in bulk annuities - taking on the risk of company defined benefit, or final salary, pension schemes.\nPrudential's shares were up 3.4 percent at 1,392 at 1053 GMT, when the FTSE 100 index .FTSE was up 1.78 percent.\nPrudential's solvency ratio is lower than that of European insurers Allianz (ALVG.DE) and AXA (AXAF.PA), which have reported ratios of 200 percent or more.\nHowever, insurers say ratios are likely to be more volatile under the new rules.\nRegulators are also concerned that investors will use the ratios as buy or sell signals for insurers across Europe.\nThe Bank of England said in an open letter last week that \"great care is required when attempting to draw comparisons on relative capital levels\".\n(Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman and Greg Mahlich)\nNext In Business News\n",

In February, it announced the start up of development of the Gour Mahmoud, In Salah, Garet el Befinat and Hassi Moumene fields, to bring output to 9 billion cubic metres a year.\nThe 2013 In Amenas attack was carried out by militants linked to veteran Algerian jihadist Mokhtar Belmokhtar, who U.S. forces say may have been killed in an air strike in Libya last year. Al Qaeda has denied he was killed.\nBelmokhtar's group Al Murabitoun or \"Those who sign in Blood\" has been blamed for several attacks across the region. Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb has also claimed recent attacks in the Ivory Coast, Mali and Burkina Faso.\nAttacks and bombings in Algeria, one of Europe's main gas suppliers, have become rarer since the North African country emerged from a 1990s war with Islamist fighters that killed around 200,000 people.\nBut Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, and its affiliates, and fighters allied with Islamic State, are active in remote pockets of the country, mainly in the desert south and the mountains east of the capital Algiers.\nAlgeria and other North African countries are also increasingly worried about the rapid expansion of Islamic State over their border in Libya, where the militant group has taken over the city of Sirte and attacked oilfields and ports.\n(Reporting by Terje Solsvik in Olso, and Patrick Markey in Algiers; Editing by Toby Chopra)\nNext In World News\n",

The joint venture would explore the possibility of sourcing new ships that are designed and built in China, along with the possibility of acquiring existing cruise ships.\nPort & Destination Development Joint Venture: In this potential joint venture, CMG and Carnival Corporation would collaborate to develop turnaround and transit ports within and around China beginning with a flagship port currently being developed by CMG called Prince Bay Cruise Terminal in Shekou, which is located in Shenzhen. The partners would work to have cruise ships sail from this flagship port, while also developing other cruise ship destinations across China and Northern Asia.\n\"The MOU we signed today signifies a great opportunity to take the next step in the future of Chinese cruising, while addressing some key needs for both the cruise industry and its passengers in China,\" said Alan Buckelew, COO of Carnival Corporation. \"With CMG's amazing track record, reach and influence in the market, we are working with a strategic partner that can help us explore immediate ways to impact cruise growth in China, including the possibility of a new Chinese cruise brand and new destinations.\"\nCarnival Corporation and CMG formalized their strategic partnership during an event held today at the Hilton Shenzhen Shekou, including an MOU signing ceremony involving Yang Tian Ping, general manager of China Merchants Shekou Industrial Zone, and Alan Buckelew, chief operations officer of Carnival Corporation. The ceremony was also attended by the vice president of China Merchants Group, Sun Cheng Ming, among other distinguished officials and guests.\nCMG, China's oldest state enterprise founded in 1872, focuses on transportation, infrastructure, financial services and real estate development, and has had a critical impact on the development of China's economy over the company's more than 140-year history. In support of China's goal to become a preeminent global cruise market, CMG and Carnival Corporation are collaborating as strategic partners to develop the infrastructure required to help accelerate growth in the cruise industry, which is one of the key emerging industries that could help fuel China's overall maritime economy.\nWhile pursuing potential joint ventures to develop and grow the overall cruise market in China, Carnival Corporation remains committed to serving its Chinese guests who are already sailing on the two Carnival brands that give the company the cruise industry's leading presence in China – Costa Cruises and Princess Cruises.\nCarnival Corporation just recently announced its plans for immediate capacity growth in China in 2015 to meet growing demand. With Costa Cruises adding the Costa Serena in China in April of this year, Carnival Corporation will be the first global cruise company with four ships homeported in China. Costa Serena joins Costa Atlantica, Costa Victoria and Sapphire Princess already homeported in China. Carnival Corporation is growing its leading market presence by 140 percent from 2013 – 2015 and expects to carry 500,000 cruise passengers in China in 2015.\nAbout Carnival Corporation\nCarnival Corporation & plc is the largest cruise company in the world, with a portfolio of cruise brands in North America, Europe, Australia and Asia, comprised of Carnival Cruise Line, Holland America Line, Princess Cruises, Seabourn, AIDA Cruises, Costa Cruises, Cunard, P&O Cruises (Australia) and P&O Cruises (UK).\nTogether, these brands operate 100 ships totaling 212,000 lower berths with 10 new ships scheduled to be delivered between 2015 and 2018. Carnival Corporation & plc also operates Holland America Princess Alaska Tours, the leading tour companies in Alaska and the Canadian Yukon.

The offering went live yesterday at the grocerâ€™s Water Lane store in Farnham, Surrey, and will be extended to 100 stores by the end of the year, meaning the service will be available at about eight percent of the companyâ€™s UK supermarkets.\nSainsburyâ€™s online director Robbie Feather said: â€œThis is yet another step for Sainsburyâ€™s increasingly popular online service, and a demonstration of our commitment to giving our customers more convenient ways to shop with us, wherever and whenever they want.â€� Feather added that Sainsburyâ€™s will be seeking feedback from customers as it rolls out the service nationwide.\nOnline shopping, as one of the better-performing parts of the market, has become a key battleground for Britain's â€˜Big Four\" supermarket chains as they grapple with the rise of discounters Aldi and Lidl. Sainsburyâ€™s launch of click-and-collect is a belated. Market leader Tesco (LON:TSCO)and Asda started such a service in 2010 and 2011 respectively. Tesco now offers the service from more than 300 of its 2,650 stores, while Asda offers it from all its 592 stores. Both companies are also experimenting with non-store collection points, such as at London Underground stations, petrol stations and schools. Britain's fourth-biggest supermarket chain, Morrisons (LON:MRW), was late to move into online grocery shopping and does not yet offer click-and-collect.\nSainsburyâ€™s share price yesterday advanced 0.63 percent to 273.70p. According to the Financial Times, of the 19 analysts projecting 12 month price targets for Sainsburyâ€™s, the median target is 235.00p, with a high estimate of 330.00p and a low of 155.00p. As of 1 March 2015, the consensus forecast amongst 31 polled investment analysts covering the supermarket group has it that investors should hold their position in the company.\n",

  "articleText" : "Shell Targets Gains From Brazil to LNG With Takeover of BG Group\nDylan Griffiths\nShare on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp\nRoyal Dutch Shell Plc’s 47 billion-pound ($70 billion) acquisition of BG Group Plc, the oil and gas industry’s biggest deal in at least a decade, combines the two companies’ assets from Brazil to Australia and the North Sea.\nShell is targeting $2.5 billion of pretax “synergies” a year across the globe from the deal , including staff cuts. Here’s a look at the worldwide effects:\nBrazil:\nThe purchase will increase Shell’s access to deepwater fields off Brazil and give the merged entity more heft in its relations with local partner Petroleo Brasileiro SA. BG’s portfolio will make Shell the leading foreign oil company in Brazil, according to Jefferies analysts led by Jason Gammel. BG’s production is set to increase to 557,000 barrels a day by 2020 from 144,000 in 2015, Jefferies said.\nBG has non-operating stakes in five blocks in the pre-salt area, an offshore region where Petrobras made the world’s largest discovery in at least three decades from 2006 to 2007. Shell also has partnerships with Petrobras, including the giant offshore Libra project in which it holds a 20 percent stake.\nAustralia:\nBG gives Shell an outlet for its natural gas reserves in Australia ’s Queensland state. Shell and its partner PetroChina Co. have been looking at alternatives for their Arrow gas project after shelving plans to build an export terminal this year due to cost blowouts and slumping energy prices. BG’s $20 billion Queensland Curtis LNG development may provide a solution for the “stranded” Arrow assets, according to Neil Beveridge, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in Hong Kong.\nNorth Sea:\nShell and BG have complementary asset portfolios in the North Sea , making job cuts “possible,” according to William Hares, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst. About 10,000 North Sea employees and contractors have lost their jobs since the price of oil began to fall last year. Shell, which employs about 2,400 across the North Sea, said March 26 that about 250 positions would go in Aberdeen , the Scottish city at the center of the U.K. oil and gas industry.\nAfrica:\nShell has downscaled operations in South Africa, where it has applied for exploration licenses to explore the semi-desert Karoo region that may hold as much as 390 trillion cubic feet of shale gas. Local exploration resources have been adjusted as the company also awaits clarity on natural resource legislation, Shell said March 16.\nShell is backing plans for an LNG plant in Tanzania, according to Ahmed Salim, a Dubai-based analyst at Teneo Intelligence. BG has a 60 percent interest in three blocks off Tanzania and is involved with plans to develop an LNG plant.\nCanada:\nThe proposal by Shell and its Asian partners for an LNG export terminal on Canada’s Pacific Coast is “one of the best, well-planned” projects, according to TransCanada Corp. Chief Executive Officer Russ Girling. The Shell project is one of more than a dozen proposals to export chilled gas by tanker from Canada’s Pacific to Asia. BG is among proponents that have delayed final decisions on Canadian projects as slumping energy prices trim cash for producers.\nShell is set to make a final decision on the Kitimat LNG terminal by mid-2016, said Girling, whose TransCanada would build a gas pipeline to serve the facility.\nU.S.:\nUntil now, Shell has had a limited stake in the emergence of the U.S. as an exporter of natural gas, with its only involvement being a 49 percent holding in a project to transform the Elba Island LNG terminal near Savannah, Georgia, into an export terminal. BG is producing gas in the Haynesville shale in Texas and in the Marcellus shale in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The company has plans to export LNG from the U.S. from the Lake Charles facility in Louisiana.\nLNG:\nThe combined entity will be the largest producer of LNG among international oil companies, Shell Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden said on Wednesday. It would have delivered 45 million metric tons of LNG in 2014, including 11 million tons from BG, Shell said. Shell’s equity LNG capacity, at projects from Australia to Russia to Nigeria, was 25.6 million tons a year at the end of 2014, the CEO said. That’s set to rise 80 percent by 2018, including new production and BG’s assets. BG’s trading portfolio will help Shell develop its business buying and selling the fuel, said Malcolm Johnson, a faculty member of The Oxford Princeton Programme who spent more than 30 years with Shell in gas and LNG.\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Severn Trent declined to comment Monday and Borealis spokeswoman Lori McLeod didn’t return calls and e-mails for comment.\nBorealis and its investment partners made two offers to buy Severn Trent in 2013 that the Coventry-based utility rejected as too low. The second bid for Severn Trent, which supplies drinking water and wastewater services to about 7.7 million people across the Midlands and mid-Wales, was priced at 2,125 pence a share with a dividend.\nAny current bid would have to surpass a 35 percent premium to the utility’s regulatory asset value, meaning it would have to be higher than Borealis’s 2013 offer, according to a note from Sanford C. Bernstein. With Severn Trent’s current market value including Monday’s gain at 5.16 billion pounds, the report of a 5 billion-pound bid represents no premium.\nOfwat, Britain’s water regulator, in December set the prices that utilities can charge for the five years through 2020. As that ended regulatory uncertainty, takeovers in the industry would likely be spurred, Michael McVeigh, director of corporate finance at Ernst & Young Global Ltd., said then.\nUnited Utilities Group Plc, the country’s biggest water company by market value, gained 3.7 percent on Monday to 987 pence. Shares of Pennon Group Plc, the third-largest of the U.K.’s publicly traded water utilities, added 4 percent to 853.5 pence as markets closed higher across the U.K. and Europe.\nIn March, Toronto-based Borealis led a group of investors in the $7 billion takeover of Fortum Oyj’s Swedish electrical distribution network.\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The blue-chip FTSE 100 index initially rose to an all-time high of 7,119.35 points but then edged back. The index was down 0.3 percent at 7,078.92 points going into the close of trading.     Pearson fell 3.6 percent, one of the worst performers on the FTSE, after the Los Angeles Times reported that the Los Angeles Unified School District was seeking a refund from Apple  over a bungled $1.3 billion effort to supply students with iPads.      The district's initiative, launched in 2013, to equip each of its roughly 650,000 students with an iPad or another computer device with curriculum material from Pearson, was the largest educational technology project of its kind in the United States.

Opinion polls put the governing Conservatives neck-and-neck with the opposition Labour party, and the Scottish National Party may emerge as the third-biggest party, raising prospects of a hung parliament.     The Conservatives have promised a referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union by the end of 2017, if they win.     Some traders have said the FTSE has managed to rise against that backdrop since the weakness in sterling could help British exporters, but Beaufort Securities' sales trader Basil Petrides was more cautious.     \"I'm not willing to buy into the market at these levels with the election just around the corner,\" he said.

In a separate development, the outgoing head of the Treasury has warned that the UK government may have to sell its stake in the bank at a loss, as keeping it in the public sector is bad both for the bank and the economy. Last year, Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne sold off the first tranche of the governmentâ€™s 79-percent stake in the bailed-out bank, triggering a Â£1-billion loss for the taxpayer.\nRBSâ€™ share price has climbed into positive territory this afternoon having added 0.44 percent to 230.60p as of 13:23 BST. The shares have lost more than 35 percent of their value over the past year and are trading well below the taxpayerâ€™s break-even price of 502p.\nSources familiar with the matter told Reuters today that RBS was axing almost 600 jobs in its UK retail bank, with the cuts occurring in branches in northern, southeast or eastern England, the Midlands or London. The move marks the latest round of job cuts and branch closures at the bailed-out lender which has been trying to shrink its footprint as it looks to return to profitability.The latest redundancies mean RBS has cut 1,500 staff across the UK so far this year.\n\"This is clearly difficult news for staff,\" Reuters quoted RBS as saying in a statement. \"We will do everything we can to support them, including seeking redeployment opportunities wherever possible.\"\nIn other RBS news, the outgoing Treasury permanent secretary Sir Nick Macpherson told the Financial Times yesterday that it was â€œgoing to be trickyâ€� for the state to offload its whole stake in RBS before the next election. He, however, argues that getting the bailed-out lender into private hands would boost lending, which in turn is expected to result in growth for the British economy.\nâ€œMy one experience of running banks is that the longer they stay in the public sector, the greater the likelihood that you will lose value,â€� he told the newspaper. Asked whether there was a case for selling the rest of the governmentâ€™s shares below the taxpayerâ€™s break-even price of 502, he commented: â€œI think that is the judgment which will have to be made.â€�\nThe Chancellor authorised an initial sale of a 5.2-percent stake in RBS at 330p per share last year, arguing that selling the first tranche at a loss would boost liquidity and fuel demand for shares.\nSir Nickâ€™s comments come after earlier this year, the Office for Budget Responsibility warned that the expected proceeds from RBS share sales between 2016-17 and 2020-21 had fallen by 26 percent to Â£21.5 billion, â€œmore than explained by the sharp fall in the share priceâ€�.\n",

  "articleText" : "RBS breaks with past by tearing investment bank apart\nRoss McEwan said the bank would call time on investment banking in 25 countries\nFriday 27 February 2015 00:34 BST\nClick to follow\nThe Independent Online\nRoss McEwan, chief executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland Getty\nThe Royal Bank of Scotland boss Ross McEwan all but tore up the remainder of Fred Goodwin’s legacy at Royal Bank of Scotland yesterday, with plans to dismantle large parts of the bank put together by the former RBS chief executive.\nMr McEwan said the bank, which reported its seventh straight year of losses, would call time on investment banking in 25 countries, saying they would never be profitable enough to justify the capital needed to keep them running.\nBut markets took a dim view of the plans and the numbers.  Ian Gordon, an analyst at Investec, reaffirmed his “sell” rating and said he expected little more than a break-even performance in 2015.\nThe upshot of Mr McEwan’s plans will be thousands of job losses in an investment banking operation that employs 16,000 people globally but will remain active in just 13 countries when the programme is complete. Mr McEwan has not said exactly how many of those jobs will go.\nThe losses, of £3.5bn, were an improvement on the £9bn recorded in 2013 and largely due to one-offs such as a £4bn writedown related to the sell-off of its US arm Citizens.\n \nBut Mr Goodwin’s legacy continues to haunt the bank, which faced £2.2bn in fines and payouts to consumers over issues such as PPI mis-selling. Mr McEwan, who has given up a £1m share allowance for 2014, said that despite its historic problems, RBS made a £3.5bn operating profit, against a loss of £7.5bn in 2013.\nHe also floated the prospect of a resumption of dividend payments in 2016, although he will have to secure the approval of the Bank of England’s Prudential Regulation Authority.\nRBS also confirmed that Sir Howard Davies will take over from Sir Philip Hampton as chairman.\nThe bank is set to sell a portfolio of $36.5bn (£23.5bn)  of US and Canadian loans to Japan’s Mizuho Bank.\nThe deal will realise a loss of £200m, but it will cut risk-weighted assets in the investment bank by around £5bn – out of the £25bn in reductions targeted for this year and £60bn by 2019.\n",

Photograph: Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images\nThursday 2 July 2015 10.57 BST\nLast modified on Thursday 2 July 2015 11.01 BST\nShare on Messenger\nClose\nPersimmon has become the latest business to confirm that consumer confidence held up ahead of the UK general election, despite concerns that the closeness of the opinion polls - erroneous as it turned out - would cool demand for housing.\nThe company, one of Britain’s biggest housebuilders, said volumes rose by 7% in the six months to the end of June and total revenues rose 12% to £1.34bn. It said:\nCustomer sentiment remained resilient through the period running up to the general election on 7 May and confidence has improved subsequently.\nDemand has been supported by an increasingly competitive mortgage market over the last six months, together with continued growth in employment and some welcome improvement in disposable incomes.\nBut Persimmon shares have edged 3p lower to £20.13 on profit taking after a good run and on a Nationwide survey showing - in slightly contracdictory fashion to the company’s view - that house prices dipped 0.2% in June.\nClyde Lewis at Peel Hunt issued a hold note on the business, saying:\nA pick up in consumer confidence post election, continued growth in the active number of sites, further expansion in the land bank and a strong net cash position were the key highlights. We see modest upgrades post this update and, while the shares don’t look cheap on a price/net asset value versus return on equity basis, our higher expectations of the capital return/dividend yield will continue to support the shares.\nLiberum said:\nPersimmon’s trading update shows that volumes are accelerating, even if inflation is not. This is a positive development but the shares have performed strongly and valuation is now stretched. We expect more subdued performance in the shares from now, even if catalysts for a reversal are hard to spot.\n",

REUTERS/Eric Vidal\nSYDNEY Australia's antitrust regulator on Thursday cleared beer giant Anheuser Busch Inbev SA's planned $100 billion takeover of rival SABMiller Plc, saying the deal would not adversely affect the domestic market.\n\"The ACCC considers that the proposed acquisition is unlikely to result in higher beer prices for consumers,\" Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) Chairman Rod Sims said in a statement.\nThe deal would not hurt competition in Australia because AB Inbev sold its beers in Australia only via distributors, \"has only a limited direct company presence in Australia and does not brew beer here,\" the ACCC said.\nThe green light from Australia removes another potential antitrust obstacle to the world's No. 1 beer company's deal to buy its nearest rival, one of the biggest corporate takeovers on record.

Analysts surveyed by Dow Jones forecast core net profit of $1.37 billion and revenue of $5.68 billion. Total revenue, which for the first time included income from licensing deals, increased 1% to $6.06 billion at constant exchange rates.\nBut the company was eager to direct the focus onto its pipeline of new drugs, especially those in a hot research area known as immuno-oncology, which looks at strengthening the body's own immune defenses to fight cancer.\nAstraZeneca reported two new licensing deals in this area, both aimed at broadening the applications of immuno-oncology drugs in its own pipeline.\nIt will pay French biotech Innate Pharma SA up to $1.28 billion to exclusively co-develop and commercialize a drug known as IP2201 as a combination therapy with its own drugs. It will also pay royalties on eventual sales.\nAstra has also done a deal with Celgene Corporation, whereby Celgene will pay the U.K.-based drug maker $450 million to develop one of its immuno-oncology treatments in a range of blood cancers. The drug, known as MEDI4736, is being developed for lung and head and neck cancer by AstraZeneca.\nPascal Soriot, chief executive, described the results as \"encouraging\" and maintained full-year guidance of a mid-single digit percentage decline in revenue and a low-single digit increase in core earnings per share. He noted that the company's oncology research program was now running 72 trials, including 31 in immuno-oncology.\nHe also highlighted the strong performance of the company's so-called \"growth platforms\"--the products or regions it is betting on as the main sources of future revenue.

In contrast, the FTSE 250 is down 8.5 percent in sterling terms.\nEnergy shares tracked crude oil prices higher.

  "articleText" : "Why Shell Cut Ties to Conservative Lobby Group Over Climate Change\nHint: It's got something to do with the company drilling offshore in the Arctic\nShare on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp\nDoes it matter that Royal Dutch Shell plans to cut ties to the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) over climate policy? \nShell follows big oil rival BP and Silicon Valley titans Google, Facebook, and Yahoo in distancing itself from ALEC, a prominent nonprofit that advocates against government regulation, primarily at the state level. The corporations quitting the group have stressed ALEC's opposition to state laws intended to curb carbon emissions and address human contributions to global warming.\n\"ALEC advocates for specific economic growth initiatives, but its stance on climate change is clearly inconsistent with our own,\" Curtis Smith, a Shell spokesman, said in a statement. In a response, ALEC said its opposition \"to government mandates and subsidies of all type\" has been mischaracterized \"as climate change denial.\"\nShell's timing deserves both scrutiny and skepticism. The multinational began to drill for oil this summer in the Chukchi Sea, northwest of Alaska. Environmentalists argue that Shell's Arctic foray not only threatens to exacerbate climate change by producing billions of additional barrels of petroleum, but it also risks a spill in a remote and ecologically sensitive region.\nOne could dismiss Shell's withdrawal from ALEC as hollow public relations, an extension of the company's yearslong attempt to foster an image of social responsibility. After all, as Ben Elgin of Bloomberg News has reported , ALEC is not the only pressure group opposing climate-friendly rules that Shell has backed while simultaneously, in Jekyll-and-Hyde fashion, insisting that it favors limits on carbon.\nBut without shilling for Shell, I'd argue that more is going on here than standard corporate double talk. Shell has developed a corporate mindset that recognizes the inevitable need to shift to renewable energy sources even as it justifies continuing to do what it's always done (drill for more oil). Shell even endorses imposition of taxes on burning oil and other CO2-emitting fuels, such as those enacted by some European countries (but not the U.S., China, or India).\nThat's not going to satisfy environmentalists, and it shouldn't. But the company's decision to depart ALEC is a reminder that it's silly to expect a $420 billion corporation to cease doing the sole task it's designed to do, especially when there are buyers for its wares. (Current oil prices mean that Shell's Arctic venture wouldn't be profitable, but the company projects that rising demand for air conditioners and automobiles in Asia will push prices back toward $100 a barrel by the time Chukchi oil comes online.)\nInstead of demanding that oil companies commit economic hari-kari, activists and politicians ought to focus on enacting the rules Shell professes to favor—and ALEC opposes—including carbon taxes, cap-and-trade systems, and the sort of emission reductions contained in the new Obama Clean Power Plan . Each time a major corporation, especially a major oil company, backs away from ALEC, the plausibility of real regulatory progress grows. \nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

  "articleText" : "Photographer: Scott Eells/Bloomberg\nThe drugmaker, whose stock has lost\nmore than two-thirds of its value since August as scrutiny on its business intensified, had been scheduled to give an overview of its fourth-quarter results on Monday, though was delaying making a formal regulatory filing. It will wait to file its annual report until an internal investigation by the board -- which is partly focused on Valeant’s relationship with controversial mail-order pharmacy Philidor Rx Services LLC -- is completed. The board committee is also looking at Valeant’s accounting.\nThe drugmaker will hold a call for sell-side analysts later Monday that will include Pearson, people familiar with the matter said, after canceling a public call that was scheduled for earlier in the day. It would be Pearson’s first event with analysts since December. The people described the call on condition of anonymity because it hasn’t been publicly announced.\n“The withdrawal of prior 2016 financial guidance is clearly negative,” said BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei, whose own estimates were below the company’s forecasts. Still, the return of Pearson as CEO is positive, because “few other executives would be as qualified, and incentivized, in turning Valeant around,” Arfaei, who rates the stock market perform, wrote in a note to investors.\nPearson built Valeant into a Wall Street darling through serial acquisitions and a lean research and development model before the drugmaker became a poster company for aggressive price hikes. The CEO, who was hospitalized in late December with severe pneumonia, went on sick leave as he was attempting to regain investors’ trust after the company came under fire for the price increases and its relationship with Philidor. “Some unexpected complications resulted in a longer hospital stay than anticipated,” Pearson, 56, wrote in a memo to employees on Jan. 25.\nThe news of his return is “encouraging because Pearson is a visionary who created significant value for shareholders over several years,” Morgan Stanley analyst David Risinger, who rates the shares neutral, wrote in a note to investors. “It also suggests that Pearson will not be implicated in any wrongdoing associated with the Philidor controversy.”\nMultiple Challenges\nPearson is returning to a company facing\nmultiple challenges . Among is the impact of its now-severed relationship with Philidor; decisions by drug benefit managers Express Scripts Holdings Co. and CVS Health Corp. to curtail coverage of expensive medicines like toenail fungus drug Jublia; a ballooning debt and the potential impact in the long term of the introduction of a generic version of its gastrointestinal drug Xifaxan.\nArfaei, the BMO analyst, said he’s not too concerned because Valeant is confident that much of its patents for the drug expire between 2019 and 2029. “Nonetheless, Xifaxan is a key growth driver for Valeant, and this adds yet another uncertainty, albeit small, for shareholders at a time of heightened sensitivity,” he wrote.\nInterim CEO Howard Schiller, a board member and the company’s former chief financial officer, will step down but remain on the board. Valeant had said in December that it expected sales of $2.7 billion to $2.8 billion in the fourth quarter, and adjusted earnings of $2.55 to $2.65 a share. For 2016, it forecast sales of $12.5 billion to $12.7 billion and adjusted earnings of $13.25 to $13.75 a share.\nIngram said Sunday that the illness had made it clear it was important to plan for a successor to the CEO. \n“Given the size and breadth of our company, succession planning and building out our senior team to provide additional resources and support for Mike are high priorities for the board,” he said in the statement.\n‘Disappointing’\n“I realize that recent events are disappointing to everyone and it is my responsibility to set the appropriate tone for the organization,” Pearson said in Sunday’s statement. “My immediate priority will be to build stronger relationships with important constituents, such as managed care and other channel partners, regulators and government representatives, while improving Valeant’s reporting procedures, internal controls and transparency.”\nPearson took over Valeant in 2008, bringing with him a business model honed over 23 years as a consultant at McKinsey & Co. that centered on an unconventional approach eschewing research and development in favor of acquisitions. He also had great ambitions: In January 2014, he said he wanted Valeant to be a top 5 pharmaceutical company by 2016.\nDeals and Debt\nHe made more than 50 acquisitions totaling $34 billion -- including Bausch & Lomb Inc., Medicis Pharmaceutical Corp. and Salix Pharmaceuticals Ltd. -- and accumulated more than $30 billion in debt. Pearson bought older treatments already on the market, at times substantially raising their prices.\nPaying down debt remains a priority for the company, Pearson said Sunday.\nThe price hikes drew criticism from lawmakers, health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers. So did reports on its relationship with Philidor, which specialized in helping doctors and patients get access to Valeant drugs even when insurers declined to cover them. Valeant said on Oct. 30 that it would cut ties with Philidor. On Dec. 15, the drugmaker announced an agreement to sell skin and eye medications through Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. at a lower price.\nWith Pearson on medical leave, interim CEO Schiller represented the drugmaker at a congressional hearing in early February and promised to end an era of sharp hikes. Schiller joined Valeant in 2011 as chief financial officer, and announced his desire to depart in April 2015. He remained a director and consultant after stepping down from his finance post.\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal. LEARN MORE\n",

  "articleText" : "â€˜Failure of leadershipâ€™ behind Tesco troubles, says former CEO Leahy\nTesco share price slightly changed following comments\nby Jane Tindall Tuesday, 20 Jan 2015, 10:39 GMT\nFormer Tesco (LON:TSCO) chief executive Sir Terry Leahy has criticised fellow ex-CEO Philip Clarke for his â€˜failure of leadershipâ€™, which he claims led to the recent crisis at the beleaguered retailer. In the BBCâ€™s Panorama programme yesterday, Leahy said that the trust of millions of customers had â€˜erodedâ€™ under his successorâ€™s management.\nLeahy, who ran Tesco from 1997 to 2011 in a period when the chain overtook Sainsburyâ€™s (LON:SBRY) to become Britainâ€™s largest grocer, also said that Tesco had lost too much senior management talent and that its low price reputation had been allowed to ebb away.\nThe veteran retailer told the programme: â€œPeople tried very hard to do the right thing; it clearly has not worked. In the end, thatâ€™s a failure of leadership, not a failure of the business, not a failure of the people who work hard every day in the business. When youâ€™re the CEO, if it goes well, you get credit, if it doesnâ€™t go well, you must take responsibility and Phil Clarke has taken that responsibility and paid the price with his job.â€�\nClarke's shock departure from Tesco last summer came after a string of poor results.  It marked a particularly torrid year for the grocer, which was rocked by a Â£263 million black hole in its finances and a string of profit warnings. Clarke was replaced by Dave Lewis, who earlier this month announced a dramatic shake-up including the closure of dozens of stores, the mothballing of others that were planned, and the sell-off of non-core businesses ( Tesco share price jumps as Q3 sales top estimates ).\nTescoâ€™s share price has been trading slightly higher so far today. As of 10:24 GMT, the stock was changing hands at 222.55p â€“ 0.52 percent up intraday. According to the Financial Times, the 17 analysts projecting 12 month price targets for the FTSE 100-listed retailer, have a median target of 180.00p, with a high estimate of 325.00p and a low of 95.00p. As of 10 January 2015, the consensus forecast amongst 53 polled investment analysts covering Tesco has it that investors should hold their position in the company.\n",

REUTERS/Michaela Rehle\nLONDON British American Tobacco (BATS.L), the world's second-largest cigarette maker, said on Thursday it would take action against the UK government if it enacts a plan to put cigarettes in \"plain packaging\".\n\"If the regulations, as published this week, are passed, we anticipate taking legal action,\" said Jerome Abelman, BAT's director of corporate and regulatory affairs.\nThe UK parliament is expected to vote on regulations to ban branding on cigarette packs before it is dissolved on March 30, in preparation for the general election on May 7.\nIf the legislation is passed, Britain would follow Australia in introducing \"plain packaging\" with the aim of improving public health and curbing the appeal of cigarettes to young people.\nTobacco companies argue that standardised packs would lead to an increase in counterfeiting and illicit trade and infringe their intellectual property rights.\n\"It's no different than if a newsagent's stand was taken by the government,\" Abelman said. \"This is our property and we don't think the government is on legal grounds to take the property.\"\nBAT's chief executive Nicandro Durante said it more plainly: \"The ambition is to get some sense.\"\nThe UK Department of Health \"intends to defend this policy robustly against any legal challenge,\" said a spokeswoman. \"We would not be proceeding with the policy if we did not believe it to be defensible in the courts.\"\nIreland is also planning to impose plain packaging, and has received threats of legal action from Imperial Tobacco Group  IMT.L and Japan Tobacco International (2914.T).\n(Reporting by Martinne Geller; Editing by Greg Mahlich)\nNext In Business News\n",

  "articleText" : "Press Releases\nMylan Appoints Ranjan Ray Chaudhuri as Global Commercial Lead for Mylan's Over-the-Counter Business\nHERTFORDSHIRE, England and PITTSBURGH, Oct. 30, 2015 / PRNewswire / -- Mylan N.V. (Nasdaq: MYL), a leading global pharmaceutical company, today announced the appointment of Ranjan Ray Chaudhuri to serve as global commercial lead of the company's over-the-counter (OTC) business. Chaudhuri will report to Rajiv Malik, president of Mylan.\nChaudhuri joins Mylan from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Consumer Healthcare, where he served for nearly three decades, and brings to Mylan a world of experience. During his time at GSK, Chaudhuri was responsible for the company's global smoking reduction and cessation category, which included NiQuitin® and other well-known nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs). Working in close partnership with market leaders, he turned around the business' performance, delivering double-digit revenue growth. In addition, Chaudhuri led the development of an innovative program designed to improve the quality of life of COPD patients by leveraging NRTs along with other GSK respiratory products, such as Advair® and Seretide®. Prior to that, Chaudhuri served as innovation director for GSK's Smoking Control and Cold Sore franchises, driving double-digit sales growth in the latter through product launches and creative advertising.\nChaudhuri recently led the divestiture of an OTC portfolio of NRT products to Perrigo, a move prompted by GSK's formation of a consumer healthcare joint venture with Novartis.\nMylan CEO Heather Bresch commented, \"As we have previously stated, we are committed to investing significantly to expand our OTC business, knowing that OTC is an important channel that will complement our existing strengths in the prescription and generic channels around the world. This is why we believe our combination with the Perrigo and Omega platforms presents such a compelling opportunity to accelerate our efforts.\"\nMylan President Rajiv Malik said, \"Ranjan joins us at an opportune time, bringing deep knowledge of the OTC space, sales and marketing leadership, experience in developed and emerging markets, and a proven track record for delivering results. He will work closely with me and my colleagues at the global level, as well as others, within both Mylan's and Perrigo's commercial structures, to further realize the combination's commercial value should we complete the Perrigo transaction.\"\nChaudhuri said, \"I have been watching Mylan's growth and performance for some time, and am extremely impressed with the caliber of its leaders, the strength of its brand, and its global team's ability to consistently perform and create value both organically and through strategic initiatives. I am also energized by the desire of Mylan's workforce to make a lasting and positive difference in the world. The opportunity to build upon Mylan's one-of-a-kind global platform and contribute to the organization's ongoing evolution is tremendously exciting to me. I look forward to bringing to Mylan all that I have learned over the years to help further distinguish it as one of the world's great companies.\"\nEarlier in his career with GSK Consumer Healthcare, Chaudhuri served in a variety of capacities, including global head of eMarketing, a function he launched; head of Strategic Planning for North America; and global director, Analgesics Category Management, during which time he drove the growth of Panadol®, GSK's leading analgesic brand, in multiple regions. In addition, he served in various sales and marketing leadership positions, and helped grow the revenue and share of products such as Panadol®, nutritional drinks Horlicks® and Boost®, and hair-styling agent Brylcreem®. Chaudhuri started his career at Unilever, selling Lipton tea in India.\nChaudhuri received a Bachelor of Arts (Honors) from St. Xavier's College in Calcutta, India, and a postgraduate diploma in business management from Institute of Modern Management, Calcutta, India.\nABOUT MYLAN\nMylan is a global pharmaceutical company committed to setting new standards in healthcare.

REUTERS/Robert Galbraith\n5/5\nBy Karolin Schaps | LONDON\nLONDON Royal Dutch Shell has abandoned its Arctic search for oil after failing to find enough crude, a move that will appease environmental campaigners and shareholders who said its project was too expensive and risky.\nThe withdrawal came six weeks after the final U.S. clearance and three months after Shell was still defending the project, a rapid change of heart for such a large company that showed it is preparing for a prolonged period of low oil prices while trying to close its $70 billion takeover of rival BG.\nShell has spent about $7 billion on exploration in the waters off Alaska so far and said it could take a hit of up to $4.1 billion for pulling out of the treacherous Chukchi Sea, where icebergs can be as large as New York's Manhattan island.\nThe unsuccessful campaign is Shell's second major setback in the Arctic after it interrupted exploration for three years in 2012 when an enormous drilling rig broke free and ran aground.\nEnvironmental campaigners and shareholders have also pressured Shell to drop Arctic drilling. Some are worried an oil spill would harm protected species while others are concerned about the cost after oil prices more than halved in a year.\nShell said the decision to withdraw from the area reflected poor results from its Burger J exploratory well, the project's high costs and the unpredictable federal regulatory environment in the area off the U.S. state of Alaska.\nA Shell source said the company had found U.S. regulation very prescriptive and in some cases contradictory, making it difficult to navigate the regulatory process.\nPresident Barack Obama's administration dealt a blow to Shell in June, ruling that laws protecting walrus and polar bears prevented Shell from drilling two rigs simultaneously at close range.\n\"The entire episode has been a very costly error for the company both financially and reputationally,\" said analysts at Deutsche Bank, who estimate the Shell's Arctic exploration project could cost the company about $9 billion.\nARCTIC CASUALTIES\nEnvironmentalists, who have criticized Shell's drilling plans in an area that is home to populations of whales, walrus and polar bears, claimed victory. In July, activists tried to stop an icebreaker key to Shell's drilling plans from leaving  port by dangling from a bridge.\nAnnie Leonard, head of Greenpeace USA, said Shell's decision was \"proof positive that drilling in the Arctic is too costly to be effective and a bad bet for other energy companies.\"\nThe decision is also the latest in a series of setbacks for projects in the Arctic to find oil and gas deposits estimated at 20 percent of the world's undiscovered resources.\nEarlier this year, Norway's Statoil postponed its Arctic Johan Castberg project again and in 2012 Russia's Gazprom, together with Total and Statoil, scrapped the Shtokman gas project in the Arctic Barents Sea.\n\"Arctic exploration has been a clear casualty of the oil price slump,\" said Peter Kiernan, oil and gas analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit.\nOil firms have dropped costly offshore projects worldwide as weak oil prices have eaten into budgets. These include BP's decision to review investment plans for the deepwater Mad Dog 2 project in the Gulf of Mexico and Husky Energy's delay to an extension of its West White Rose field off Canada.\n\"Alaska been a bone of contention for many investors thus today's update is a positive,\" said Bernstein analysts, who rate Shell's stock as outperform.\nSenator Lisa Murkowski, an Alaskan Republican, said she was disappointed by the decision. The U.S. Interior Department \"placed significant limits on this season's activities, which resulted in a drilling rig sitting idle,\" she said.\nShell's London-listed shares moved up in early trading but later fell more than 2.8 percent.\nShell said its Alaskan project was valued at about $3 billion on its balance sheet and that it had a $1.1 billion in future contractual commitments. It said it would give an update on the cost of writedowns with third-quarter results.\n(Additional reporting by Abhiram Nandakumar in Bengaluru and Timothy Gardner in Washington; editing by David Clarke and Cynthia Osterman)\nNext In Commodities\nShell CEO expects no valuation hit from climate accord\nAMSTERDAM Royal Dutch Shell expects to pump out all the fossil fuel reserves listed on its balance sheet, its chief executive said, dismissing concerns that production limits in the wake of the Paris climate accord could hit the energy giant's valuation.\n",

  "articleURL" : "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-01/standard-chartered-rbs-escape-capital-raising-in-stress-test",
  "articleText" : "QuickTake Stress Tests\nNeither bank will have to raise additional cash from investors despite falling short in some parts of the assessment, the BOE said on Tuesday. Standard Chartered’s “recent strategy review and the associated steps taken to strengthen its capital position” meant it didn’t need to submit a new plan. RBS was also let off after raising billions from the sales of its U.S. consumer bank and announcing debt issuance plans.\nThe BOE’s second public stress test is helping restore investor confidence in the financial system seven years after global crisis forced the government to bail out lenders including RBS and Lloyds Banking Group Plc. While Standard Chartered was seen as\nmost at risk , with regulators increasing scrutiny on emerging-market exposure, RBS has struggled to shore up capital buffers hurt by increasing costs tied to past misconduct.\n‘Broadly Favorable’\n“We view the outcome of this review as broadly favorable for the sector and investors should therefore breathe a sigh of relief,” said Gary Greenwood, an analyst at Shore Capital in Liverpool, England. He has a buy recommendation on Standard Chartered shares and a hold on RBS.\nRBS increased 2.6 percent at 10:17 a.m. in London, while Standard Chartered advanced 1.1 percent after declining on the two previous days. Lloyds, which reported the strongest capital level in the industry, jumped 2.5 percent.\nBritain’s largest banks were probed on their resilience to shocks including a Chinese slowdown, a shrinking euro-area economy and plunging commodity prices. Under the stressed scenario, the seven lenders would have seen 100 billion pounds ($151 billion) of profit erased, more than during the financial crisis.\nRBS missed its individual-capital guidance in the examination based on end-2014 data, the BOE’s Prudential Regulation Authority said. Standard Chartered also failed to meet its 6 percent target capital ratio, a measure of financial strength. In the assessment, the emerging-markets focused lender saw its ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets fall to as low as 5.1 percent, above the minimum 4.5 percent pass mark. At RBS, the measure dipped to 5.9 percent.\nCapital Increase\nIn November, Standard Chartered Chief Executive Officer Bill Winters unveiled plans to raise $5.1 billion and boost the bank’s common equity Tier 1 ratio to 13.1 percent from 11.5 percent. The shares are on sale through Dec. 10.\n“The results of the test demonstrate our resilience to a marked slowdown across the key markets in which we operate,” Winters said in an e-mailed statement. Since 2014 “we have made further significant progress in strengthening our capital position” and “have a number of additional levers at our disposal to further manage capital.”\nRBS, led by CEO Ross McEwan, earlier this year completed a sale of its Citizens Financial Group Inc. U.S. consumer bank after taking the company public in 2014. He’s also disposed billions of pounds of toxic assets housed within its bad bank and taken steps to dismantle the investment bank, exiting 25 countries around the world.\n“We are pleased with the progress we have made relative to the 2014 stress test, but recognize we still have much to do to restore RBS to be a strong and resilient bank for our customers,” RBS Chief Financial Officer Ewen Stevenson said in a statement.\nHSBC, Barclays\nLloyds reported the strongest capital ratio in the tests with a CET1 of 9.5 percent when management actions are taken into account, followed by HSBC Holdings Plc at 7.7 percent. Barclays Plc passed with a 7.3 percent ratio.\nBoth Standard Chartered and HSBC generate most of their earnings in Asia, making them more vulnerable in the latest stress tests after the BOE focused on domestic threats in the previous round of health assessments.\nThe stressed scenario included a global slowdown, with shrinking economies in the euro area and the U.K., near stagnation in the U.S. and slump in emerging markets, sparking a drop in oil prices to $38 a barrel. In China, the model simulated a drop in property prices and economic growth cooling to 1.7 percent, with Hong Kong “particularly impacted by the downturn.” The model also took into account currency fluctuations, including a 25 percent plunge in the euro against the dollar and a 15 percent drop versus the pound.\nMisconduct Costs\nIn addition to the macroeconomic risks and trading risks, the BOE also included estimates for potential misconduct costs and fines beyond those paid or provided for by the end of 2014. Over the five years of the stress scenario, the central bank assumed such costs would reduce earnings by around 40 billion pounds.\nThe banks also had to maintain a 3 percent leverage ratio to pass the test. They were allowed to include measures such as asset disposals or cost cuts in order to pass. RBS and Standard Chartered would have failed if they hadn’t been allowed to take past capital-raising efforts into account or if bonds hadn’t converted to equity.\n‘Big Piece’\n“The BOE will not allow the banks to rest on their laurels,” said Simon Hunt, U.K. banking and capital markets leader at PricewaterhouseCoopers. “The pass mark for next year’s stress test will be higher and the scenarios may well be more severe if the economy continues to improve.”\nThe BOE, led by Mark Carney, published the results alongside its latest Financial Stability Report in which it outlined its thinking on capital regulation. It signaled it will gradually increase the countercyclical-capital buffer to 1 percent as the U.K. economy recovers from the crisis and risks to stability re-emerge. The buffer forces banks to set aside capital to support lending in a downturn and is currently at zero percent.\n“The big piece of news is that there is no counter-cyclical buffer,” said Raul Sinha, a banking analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co. “The BOE will review it on a quarterly basis, which confirms an element of uncertainty, but there’s no hike this morning. Given market fears expect a big sigh of relief.”\nCarney said the banking industry’s capital was now “within sight of its resting point” as they have taken actions to bolster resilience in the wake of the financial crisis. While some institutions still need to take some steps to make improvements, “a lot has been done. This is a resilient system, you see it through the stress test,” he said.\nThis year’s test covered Standard Chartered, HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds, Nationwide Building Society, RBS and Santander U.K. Plc.\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

  "articleText" : "TAGRISSO™ (AZD9291) approved by the US FDA for patients with EGFR T790M mutation-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer\nPUBLISHED 13 November 2015\n13 November 2015\nOne of fastest development programmes – from start of clinical trials to approval in just over two and a half years to meet unmet patient need\nWith objective response rate of 59% and duration of response of 12.4 months, TAGRISSO provides important new option for patients\nAstraZeneca today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved TAGRISSO™ (AZD9291) 80mg once-daily tablets for the treatment of patients with metastatic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) T790M mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as detected by an FDA-approved test, who have progressed on or after EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy.\nAZD9291 is the only approved medicine indicated for patients with metastatic EGFR T790M mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer. This indication is approved under the FDA’s accelerated approval process based on tumour response rate and duration of response (DoR).\nAZD9291 is an EGFR-TKI, a targeted cancer therapy, designed to inhibit both the activating, sensitising mutations (EGFRm), and T790M, a genetic mutation responsible for EGFR-TKI treatment resistance. Nearly two-thirds of NSCLC patients who are EGFR mutation-positive and experience disease progression after being treated with an EGFR-TKI develop the T790M resistance mutation, for which there have been limited treatment options.\nPasi A Jänne MD, PhD, Director, Lowe Center for Thoracic Oncology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Scientific Director, Belfer Center for Applied Cancer Science and Professor of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, said: “In the AURA clinical studies, AZD9291 has demonstrated compelling early efficacy and tolerability in patients with EGFRm T790M metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. This treatment has the potential to become the standard of care for patients living with EGFRm T790M non-small cell lung cancer. The accelerated approval of AZD9291 highlights its clinical promise for a targeted group of patients and gives healthcare providers an important new option.”\nPascal Soriot, Chief Executive Officer, AstraZeneca, said: “The FDA approval of TAGRISSO marks an important milestone for lung cancer patients who urgently need new treatment options. We have built on our heritage in this area and acted on the breakthrough clinical evidence to ensure this next-generation medicine reaches patients in record time. As we advance our comprehensive lung cancer portfolio, we have the opportunity to treat greater numbers of patients across all stages of this disease through precision medicines, immunotherapies and novel combinations.”\nAstraZeneca has collaborated with Roche to develop the cobas® EGFR Mutation Test v2 as the companion diagnostic for AZD9291. The cobas® EGFR Mutation Test v2 is intended to identify a range of EGFR mutations in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, including T790M.\nAZD9291 was granted Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, Priority Review and Accelerated Approval status by the FDA. In Europe and Japan, AZD9291 was granted Accelerated Assessment and Priority Review status respectively. Interactions with regulatory authorities in the rest of the world are ongoing.\nThe FDA approval of AZD9291 is based on data from the two AURA Phase II studies (AURA extension and AURA2) which demonstrated efficacy in 411 EGFRm T790M NSCLC patients that had progressed on or after an EGFR TKI. In those trials, overall objective response rate ((ORR) a measurement of tumor shrinkage) was 59% (95% CI: 54% to 64%). In a supportive Phase I study in 63 patients, ORR was 51% and median duration of response was 12.4 months.\nThe AZD9291 tolerability profile showed that no individual severe grade 3+ adverse events occurred at ≥ 3.5%.The most common adverse events were generally mild to moderate and included diarrhoea (42% all grades; 1.0% Grade 3/4),  rash (41% all grades; 0.5% Grade 3/4), dry skin (31% all grades; 0% Grade 3/4), and nail toxicity (25% all grades; 0% Grade 3/4). There are no contraindications for AZD9291. Warnings and precautions include interstitial lung disease, QT interval prolongation, cardiomyopathy and embryofoetal toxicity.\nAZD9291 Development Programme\nAZD9291 is being studied in the confirmatory trial, AURA3, an open label, randomised Phase III study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of AZD9291 versus platinum-based doublet chemotherapy in patients with EGFR T790M positive, locally advanced, or metastatic NSCLC who have progressed following prior therapy with an EGFR-TKI. AZD9291 is also being investigated in the adjuvant setting and in the metastatic first-line setting, including in patients with brain metastases, as well as in combination with other compounds.\nNOTES TO EDITORS\nAbout Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women, accounting for about one-third of all cancer deaths, more than breast, prostate and colorectal cancers combined. Lung cancer has a five-year survival rate that is less than 20%. Approximately 85% of all lung cancers in the US are NSCLC; 10% to 15% of these are EGFR mutation-positive. Approximately two-thirds of patients treated with EGFR TKI therapy will acquire resistance related to the T790M mutation.\nAbout AZD9291\nAZD9291 80mg once-daily tablet is the first medicine indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) T790M mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as detected by an FDA-approved test, who have progressed on or after EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. Non-clinical in vitro studies have demonstrated that AZD9291 has high potency and inhibitory activity against mutant EGFR phosphorylation across the range of clinically relevant EGFRm and T790M mutant NSCLC cell lines with significantly less activity against EGFR in wild-type cell lines.\nOsimertinib has recently been published by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as the proposed International Non-proprietary Name (INN) for AZD9291, and may become formally adopted during November 2015. In the US, the American Medical Association accepted osimertinib as the United States Adopted Name (USAN).\nAbout AstraZeneca in Oncology\nOncology is a therapeutic area in which AstraZeneca has deep-rooted heritage. It will be potentially transformational for the company’s future, becoming the sixth growth platform. Our vision is to help patients by redefining the cancer treatment paradigm and one day eliminate cancer as cause of death.

  "articleText" : "CEO Staley adds another executive from U.S. bank to top team\nPaul Compton replaces Jonathan Moulds at British lender\nShare on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp\nBarclays Plc named Paul Compton chief operating officer, poaching another senior executive from JPMorgan Chase & Co. for the U.K. bank’s top management team.\nCompton, who worked for the U.S. bank since 1997 and was most recently chief administrative officer, starts in May and will report to Chief Executive Officer Jes Staley, London-based Barclays said in a statement Tuesday. He replaces Jonathan Moulds, who’s leaving after just over a year at the company.\nStaley, a former CEO of JPMorgan’s investment bank, has installed his own lieutenants in Barclays’s senior executive ranks since starting Dec. 1, hiring C.S. “Venkat” Venkatakrishnan as chief risk officer two weeks ago, also from JPMorgan. Staley has imposed a hiring freeze and is cutting jobs at the investment bank as he moves to reduce costs to improve profitability. The lender is due to present a broader strategic update with full-year results on March 1.\nCompton’s responsibilities will include operations and technology, structural reform, cost cutting, sourcing and administration, and he will oversee the bank’s operating committee, according to the statement.\nJPMorgan Influx\n“For nearly 20 years Mr. Compton has served in a variety of senior operating roles,” Staley said in the statement. “His huge directly relevant experience will prove invaluable as we continue our strategic transformation and manage the required changes under structural reform.”\nCompton will join at least four other members of the 12-person executive committee that also built their careers at JPMorgan. Staley spent 34 years at the New York-based firm, including stints running its asset-management and investment-bank divisions. Finance Director Tushar Morzaria joined Barclays from JPMorgan in 2013 and head of compliance Michael Roemer spent 23 years at the U.S. bank.\nMoulds was asked to step aside as COO by Staley, who wanted to install his own choice in the role, according to a person familiar with the move, who asked not identified because they aren’t authorized to speak about the matter publicly. Staley “would have liked him to have stayed with the company in another capacity,” the CEO said in the statement.\nFormer CEO Antony Jenkins, who was fired in July, appointed Moulds, a 15-year veteran of Bank of America Merrill Lynch, in January 2015.\nJPMorgan Changes\nCompton served as co-CAO and chief financial officer of JPMorgan’s investment bank under Staley. He previously worked at Ernst & Young LLP, according to his biography on the\nwebsite of the Deposit Trust & Clearing Corp., where he serves on the board of directors.\nJPMorgan’s corporate technology group, which is run by Chief Information Officer Dana Deasy and had been overseen by Compton, will now report directly to COO Matt Zames, said Joe Evangelisti, a bank spokesman. Smaller staff groups that Compton led will report temporarily to Zames, Evangelisti said.\nBarclays fell 4.7 percent to 156.25 pence in London on Tuesday, extending its decline this year to 29 percent. The stock also dropped about 10 percent in both 2014 and 2015.\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal. LEARN MORE\n",

  "articleText" : "Business News | Mon Feb 15, 2016 | 9:21am GMT\nBAE Systems lines up oil executive Woodburn as next CEO\nBy Sarah Young | LONDON\nLONDON British defence firm BAE Systems (BAES.L) named Charles Woodburn as its chief operating officer, making the former oil executive heir apparent for the chief executive's role.\nBAE's statement on Monday followed media reports on Sunday that Woodburn would be appointed to the role before taking over the top job from Ian King in 12 to 18 months. King has run BAE since 2008 having formerly been chief operating officer.\nWoodburn, 44, who formerly worked at oilfield services company Schlumberger (SLB.N) and is currently chief executive at private equity-backed Expro, will join in the second quarter of 2016 and be paid a base salary of 750,000 pounds ($1.1 million).\nKing highlighted Woodburn's international focus as an advantage for BAE, the third biggest defence company globally, which makes over a third of its sales in the U.S. and Canada, and a fifth in Saudi Arabia.\n\"As a highly qualified engineer with considerable international business experience, Charles will strengthen and broaden the strategic and operational capabilities of the business as a welcome and valuable addition to the leadership team,\" King said in a statement.\nChairman Roger Carr said that Woodburn would build up his understanding of the defence industry under King, calling his appointment \"part of our succession planning programme.\"\nWoodburn will need to get to grips with BAE's biggest customer -- Britain's ministry of defence -- as the company takes part in a 31 billion pound programme to build the replacement for the country's nuclear submarines.\nBAE is expected to benefit from rising military spending in Britain and the U.S., after years of cutbacks, and new demand for its cyber defence services.\nBut it also faces challenges. It is under pressure from the British government to deliver big, complicated projects like the building of two new aircraft carriers on budget, and to secure a long-delayed sale of a new batch of Typhoon fighter jets to Saudi Arabia to extend its production further into the future.\nKeplerCheuvreux analyst Christophe Menard said the appointment was positive for BAE.\n\"Seeking an outsider could bring a fresh vision to BAE, which needs to reinvent and re-position part of its business, after years of difficulty budgetary environments,\" he said.\nWoodburn, who has a PhD in engineering from the University of Cambridge, will also be paid 1.62 million pounds earnt at Expro but forfeited as a consequence of joining BAE.\nThe company's shares traded up 1.9 percent to 475 pence, broadly in line with the FTSE 100 index. BAE is scheduled to report annual results on Thursday.\n(Reporting by Sarah Young; Editing by Paul Sandle and Keith Weir)\nNext In Business News\n",

  "articleText" : "Diageo share price down after mixed bag of half-year results\nAdverse currency movements weigh on revenue\nby Mary Morley Thursday, 28 Jan 2016, 08:40 GMT\nDiageoâ€™s (LON:DGE) share price edged lower at the opening bell this morning after the worldâ€™s largest spirits maker reported a slight rise in first half pre-tax profit despite a drop in revenue, as organic sales grew more than expected.\nThe FTSE 100-listed distiller, whose brands include Guinness, Smirnoff vodka and Johnnie Walker whiskey, said in statement today that its pre-tax profit had edged up to Â£1.78 billion in the six months ended December 31 from Â£1.64 billon in the same period a year ago, while revenue slipped to Â£8.27 billion from Â£8.72 billion. Diageo revealed that adverse currency movements and the disposal of non-core assets had reduced net sales by Â£400 million and operating profit by Â£156 million in the period.\nThe groupâ€™s half-year organic net sales were 1.8 percent up, while volumes grew by one percent. This was better than the 1.6 percent net sales rise and 0.6 percent volume growth that had been expected by analysts. Diageo further announced that it would increase its interim dividend by five percent to 22.6p a share.\nLooking ahead, the distiller said it remained confident of achieving its objective of mid-single digit top line growth and 100 basis points of organic operating margin improvement in the three years ending fiscal 2019. CEO Ivan Menezes stated: \"While trading conditions remain challenging in some markets, Diageo's brands, capabilities in marketing and innovation and our route to consumer have proved resilient. I am confident that Diageo can deliver improved, sustained performance.\"\nBy 08:18 GMT, Diageoâ€™s share price had fallen 0.67 percent to 1,854.50p. The stock was underperforming the FTSE 100 benchmark, which meanwhile stood 0.28 percent up at 6,008.69 points.\n",

  "articleText" : "Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and Lloyds Banking Group Plc are the two major U.K. lenders most exposed to the commercial real estate market, which poses a risk for banks after asset managers\nfroze withdrawals from property funds, JPMorgan Chase & Co. said.\nRBS has 25.2 billion pounds ($33 billion) of lending to the sector, accounting for 66 percent of its tangible net asset value, a measure of capital, and Lloyds has 18.1 billion pounds, or about 46 percent of its TNAV, Raul Sinha, an analyst, said in a report dated July 5. While the risks for major banks are “manageable,” small lenders could see greater losses because of higher loan-to-value ratios on their CRE debt.\n“Downside risk from U.K. commercial property prices is likely to pressure domestic U.K.-exposed bank valuations,” Sinha wrote. “Major U.K. banks have broadly maintained their underwriting standards in recent years, with smaller banks and building societies including challenger banks having a relatively high proportion of more highly leveraged CRE loans.”\nThis week, three asset managers halted withdrawals from real-estate funds after investors rushed to redeem money as concern grows about the future of the British economy. The pound has dropped to a 31-year low less than two weeks after the nation voted to leave the European Union. The Bank of England said Tuesday it was “closely monitoring” valuations in the commercial real-estate market and moved to ease banks’ capital requirements.\nMore Stress\nThe shock caused by the freezes in the real estate funds may prompt more redemptions from investors, putting them under more stress, Morgan Stanley told clients in a report. The analysts said 45 percent of investors in the funds weren’t British and therefore would also be suffering from the devaluation of the pound.\nA collapse in prices would “hurt Lloyds and RBS particularly badly; both have large commercial property loan portfolios, and the coming falls in commercial property price indices will translate into higher required impairment provisions against them,” Cenkos Securities analyst Sandy Chen said in a separate report sent Wednesday, which reiterated sell ratings on both lenders.\nThe industry as a whole has 86 billion pounds of commercial real estate lending, “reduced significantly” from five years ago, when it totaled more than 150 billion pounds, JPMorgan said. The major banks have 69 billion pounds of exposure and smaller banks and building societies hold the remaining 17 billion pounds. Societe Generale SA analysts echoed Sinha’s warning smaller challenger banks were most at risk due to high leverage.\nBanks will be shielded from losses of the scale seen in the 2008 and 2009 financial because they’ve shrunk their portfolios and lent a smaller portion of the property’s value, analysts at HSBC said. Risk-aversion, new regulations and recent increases in property prices account for the change, Ivan Zubo and Robin Down wrote in a note to clients.\nJPMorgan cut its 2018 earnings per share estimates for U.K. banks by 22 percent last week.\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Valeant and Astra will also share profits on sales of the drug.\nUnder the deal, Valeant said it will assume all development costs associated with the regulatory approval for brodalumab.

  "articleText" : "Cyclical Consumer Goods | Tue Mar 10, 2015 | 11:38am GMT\nRPT-UPDATE 2-Tesco turnaround gathers pace under new CEO\n(Repeats to fix formatting, no change to text)     * Kantar says Tesco sales up 1.1 pct in 12 weeks to March 1 * Says Tesco resurgence hurting Asda     * Discounters' growth slowing      LONDON, March 10 Britain's Tesco posted its strongest sales performance in 18 months, industry data showed on Tuesday, adding to evidence that new boss Dave Lewis's turnaround plan is making an impact as a supermarket price war intensifies.     Since joining the troubled grocer last September, Lewis has cut prices on fresh produce and branded goods, improved product availability and stepped up customer service, seeking to win back shoppers who deserted Britain's biggest supermarket chain for discounters Aldi and Lidl.       Data from market researcher Kantar Worldpanel showed that Tesco's sales rose 1.1 percent over the 12 weeks to March 1, suggesting that Lewis's plan may be working.     The increase helped Tesco to arrest its falling market share, which was down only a tenth of a percentage point to 28.7 percent compared with last year.     Shares in Tesco are down a quarter year on year but are up 37 percent over the past three months on recovery hopes. They were flat on Tuesday.     Though Aldi and Lidl recorded sales increases of 19.3 percent and 13.6 percent respectively, their growth has been slowing in recent months.     Kantar said that Tesco's resurgence has had an impact on Asda, Britain's second-biggest supermarket chain, which competes for many of the same shoppers as Tesco. Asda sales fell 2.1 percent, taking its market share down half a percentage point to 17 percent.     Last month Asda, the British arm of U.S. group Wal-Mart , blamed a fall in its sales on the unprecedented use of discount vouchers by its rivals among the so-called Big Four grocers and warned that the practice was unsustainable.       Sales at Sainsbury's and Morrisons, the third and fourth-biggest players, fell 0.5 percent and 0.4 percent respectively.     Last month's Kantar data had showed Tesco increasing its sales for the first time since January 2014.      Kantar said that the overall grocery market increased sales by 1.1 percent in the 12-week period, while deflation reached a new low of minus 1.6 percent as price competition between the rivals continued.     \"All of the major supermarkets are cutting prices to win shoppers, especially within everyday staples such as eggs, vegetables and milk,\" said Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar Worldpanel.

The rally is not going to all peter out, though having said that the jump today is in large part because of short covering,\" BNP Paribas strategist Stephen Briggs said.\nZinc mine supply had already been set to shrink given the closure of MMG's huge Century mine in Australia and Lisheen in Ireland this year.\n\"The cut is certainly significant and swings the zinc market into a deficit for 2016, which we estimate will now be around 300,000 tonnes, a reversal of the 180,000 tonne surplus we were forecasting earlier,\" analyst Edward Meir at INTL FCSTone said in a note.\nLondon Metal Exchange three-month zinc shot up to an intraday peak of $1,875 a tonne, a gain of 12.5 percent. That was its highest price since Aug. 11 and its biggest single-day gain in Reuters data, which goes back to mid-2005. It closed up 10.1 percent at $1,835.\nZinc prices sank to their lowest in over five years at$1,601.50 late last month, partly on an overhang of inventories.\nAlso supporting metals was a weaker dollar index, which fell on the view that the U.S. Federal Reserve is in no rush to raise interest rates, making commodities cheaper for buyers outside of the United States.\nLead, which is often mined alongside zinc, surged nearly 9 percent at one point to $1,821.50 a tonne, its highest since late July, before paring gains to close at $1,780, up 6.4 percent.\nCopper climbed 3 percent to finish at $5,290 a tonne while aluminium gained 3.3 percent to end at $1,613.\nNickel raced 6 percent higher to a two-month peak of $10,785 a tonne before retreating. It failed to trade in closing open outcry activity and was bid at $10,500, up 3.2 percent. Tin  added 1.6 percent to close at $16,150.\nFor metals, concerns persist about the growth slowdown in China, which consumes about half the world's copper.\nSenior metals executives in China expect most base metals will face tepid demand there next year.\nPRICES\n",

  "articleText" : "South African drugmaker will also make sales-related payments\nDeal comes after Aspen secured 3 billion euros in funding\nShare on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp\nAspen Pharmacare Holdings Ltd. agreed to buy anesthetics medicines from AstraZeneca Plc for at least $520 million, the first acquisition by Africa’s largest generic-drugs maker since securing new funding.\nThe South African company will also pay AstraZeneca royalties and as much as $250 million in additional sales-based installments over the next two years, Durban-based Aspen said in a statement on Thursday. Aspen will gain seven established drugs sold in more than 100 countries that generate revenue of $592 million a year.\nFor AstraZeneca, the agreement builds on a string of deals where it has licensed out products that aren’t core to its business to boost revenue and enable investment in focus areas like cancer. Revenue from such “externalization,” as the company calls it, was $1.1 billion last year, and the company expects to generate more than that this year.\nAstraZeneca’s anesthetics are “very different” from the rest of the company’s products because they are marketed to hospitals rather than to doctors, said Luke Miels, executive vice president of global product and portfolio strategy. AstraZeneca’s market share in anesthetics has fallen to 14 percent from 22 percent since 2011, he said. The market as a whole is “heavily genericized, with minimal differentiation,” and not one that AstraZeneca would like to compete in, he said.\nThrough the deal, AstraZeneca will benefit from Aspen’s relationships with hospitals. AstraZeneca’s 360 employees working on anesthetics sales globally will be offered the option of going to Aspen.\nAspen shares gained 9.5 percent to 351.41 rand by 4:07 p.m. in Johannesburg, on track for their biggest gain in almost four months. AstraZeneca shares fell 1.4 percent to 3,974.5 pence in London.\nAnesthetics are “a therapeutic category that presents the opportunity to add significant value,” Aspen said. “The key territories in which the portfolio is sold represent an excellent fit with Aspen’s existing operational geographic footprint.”\nThe deal comes a day after Aspen said it had secured 3 billion euros ($3.4 billion) in funding, attracting support from 27 banks. The company has spent more than $2 billion on acquisitions from drugmakers including GlaxoSmithKline Plc and Merck & Co. in recent years to boost its array of medicines and manufacturing sites, and now sells products in more than 150 countries.\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

REUTERS/Toby Melville\n1/2\nleft\nright\nAn employee stands near a window, with the company logo of installed on a building, at the headquarters of the Russian natural gas producer Gazprom in Moscow, February 24, 2015. REUTERS/Maxim Zmeyev\n2/2\nBy Denis Pinchuk and Katya Golubkova | MOSCOW\nMOSCOW Royal Dutch Shell's (RDSa.L) plans to build a strategic alliance with Russia's Gazprom (GAZP.MM) could be in jeopardy after the United States added one of Gazprom's biggest gas fields to its list of Russian sanctions on Friday.\nShell and Gazprom signed an agreement in June to develop a strategic alliance in the gas sector, ranging from upstream - exploration and production - to sales, including possible asset swaps.\nDevelopment of the Yuzhno-Kirinskoye field on the island of Sakhalin in the Pacific, a project known as Sakhalin-3, has been seen as central to that alliance as it would allow the two companies to expand their sole existing LNG venture, Sakhalin-2, located nearby.\nState-owned Gazprom was believed to be considering selling a stake in Sakhalin-3 to Shell, which confirmed only last week that it was interested in buying a share, possibly through an asset swap, according to Bloomberg. It may now have to rethink those plans.\nOn Friday the U.S. government said it was restricting exports, re-exports and transfers of technology and equipment to the Yuzhno-Kirinskoye field.\nShell, with considerable assets in the United States, would face consequences if it went against the sanction, as would other potential foreign investors.\nU.S. officials have repeatedly said that sanctions on Russia's energy sector - part of broader penalties imposed since 2014 over Moscow's involvement in Ukraine - would target new projects, not existing supplies as that could cause a spike in global energy prices.\n\"It is clear that this is a signal to Shell - don't go into new projects, deal with existing ones,\" an executive at a Russian energy company who works on projects in Sakhalin said, on condition of anonymity.\nLast year, Washington slapped sanctions on an Arctic project that state-owned Russian oil major Rosneft (ROSN.MM) planned to develop with U.S. oil major ExxonMobil (XOM.N), effectively forcing the two companies to suspend drilling despite the discovery of oil.\nSanctions have also affected Russian energy firms' ability to raise long-term funding and plans to develop shale and deep-water oil resources.\nHowever, this is the first time natural gas production has been targeted and Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said on Friday that new U.S. sanctions would further damage bilateral relations.\nSeveral sources at Gazprom said its lawyers were studying the impact of the U.S. decision. Executives at the company, which announced a 71 percent jump in first-quarter net profit on Monday, told a conference call it was too early to say how the decision could affect the project.\nSURGICAL STRIKE\nGazprom wants Sakhalin-3 to provide gas to expand capacity at Sakhalin-2 to as much as 15 million tonnes a year by the next decade from 10 million currently. Shell is the only foreign investor to have expressed interest so far.\nAlexander Kornilov, energy analyst at Alfa Bank in Moscow, said Gazprom would have to postpone development of Yuzhno-Kirinskoye and the planned expansion of Sakhalin-2 as both would require Western drilling and liquefaction technologies, which Russia is lacking.\n\"New sanctions is a surgical strike aimed at slowing down Gazprom's LNG projects in Asia. It will be impossible for Gazprom to develop Yuzhno-Kirinskoye without partners,\" he said citing difficult drilling conditions.\nSakhalin is one of the most important regions in Russia for foreign investment due to its offshore deposits. Yuzhno-Kirinskoye has reserves of 640 billion cubic metres - enough to supply Japan for five years - and 97 million tonnes of gas condensate, a by-product similar to oil.\nShell and Gazprom have invested more than $20 billion in Sakhalin-2, one of the world's largest liquefaction plants and Japan Mitsui (8031.T) and Mitsubishi Corp (8058.T) are also investors.\nShell said it was engaging with the relevant authorities and taking action to ensure it complies with all applicable sanctions or related measures.\n\"Shell remains committed to working in Russia and we value working with our Russian partners and colleagues,\" a Shell spokeswoman said.\n(Writing by Dmitry Zhdannikov; Editing by Susan Fenton)\nNext In Global Energy News\n",

  "articleText" : "Innovation and Intellectual Property | Mon Sep 28, 2015 | 3:44pm EDT\nUPDATE 6-Royal Dutch Shell pulls plug on Arctic exploration\n(Adds background on U.S. species protections slowing down Shell's drilling, Greenpeace quote, Senator Murkowski quote)\nBy Karolin Schaps\nLONDON, Sept 28 Royal Dutch Shell has abandoned its Arctic search for oil after failing to find enough crude, a move that will appease environmental campaigners and shareholders who said its project was too expensive and risky.\nThe withdrawal came six weeks after the final U.S. clearance and three months after Shell was still defending the project, a rapid change of heart for such a large company that showed it is preparing for a prolonged period of low oil prices while trying to close its $70 billion takeover of rival BG.\nShell has spent about $7 billion on exploration in the waters off Alaska so far and said it could take a hit of up to $4.1 billion for pulling out of the treacherous Chukchi Sea, where icebergs can be as large as New York's Manhattan island.\nThe unsuccessful campaign is Shell's second major setback in the Arctic after it interrupted exploration for three years in 2012 when an enormous drilling rig broke free and ran aground.\nEnvironmental campaigners and shareholders have also pressured Shell to drop Arctic drilling. Some are worried an oil spill would harm protected species while others are concerned about the cost after oil prices more than halved in a year.\nShell said the decision to withdraw from the area reflected poor results from its Burger J exploratory well, the project's high costs and the unpredictable federal regulatory environment in the area off the U.S. state of Alaska.\nA Shell source said the company had found U.S. regulation very prescriptive and in some cases contradictory, making it difficult to navigate the regulatory process.\nPresident Barack Obama's administration dealt a blow to Shell in June, ruling that laws protecting walrus and polar bears prevented Shell from drilling two rigs simultaneously at close range.\n\"The entire episode has been a very costly error for the company both financially and reputationally,\" said analysts at Deutsche Bank, who estimate the Shell's Arctic exploration project could cost the company about $9 billion.\nARCTIC CASUALTIES\nEnvironmentalists, who have criticised Shell's drilling plans in an area that is home to populations of whales, walrus and polar bears, claimed victory. In July, activists tried to stop an icebreaker key to Shell's drilling plans from leaving  port by dangling from a bridge.\nAnnie Leonard, head of Greenpeace USA, said Shell's decision was \"proof positive that drilling in the Arctic is too costly to be effective and a bad bet for other energy companies.\"\nThe decision is also the latest in a series of setbacks for projects in the Arctic to find oil and gas deposits estimated at 20 percent of the world's undiscovered resources.\nEarlier this year, Norway's Statoil postponed its Arctic Johan Castberg project again and in 2012 Russia's Gazprom, together with Total and Statoil, scrapped the Shtokman gas project in the Arctic Barents Sea.\n\"Arctic exploration has been a clear casualty of the oil price slump,\" said Peter Kiernan, oil and gas analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit.\nOil firms have dropped costly offshore projects worldwide as weak oil prices have eaten into budgets. These include BP's  decision to review investment plans for the deepwater Mad Dog 2 project in the Gulf of Mexico and Husky Energy's delay to an extension of its West White Rose field off Canada.\n\"Alaska been a bone of contention for many investors thus today's update is a positive,\" said Bernstein analysts, who rate Shell's stock as outperform.\nSenator Lisa Murkowski, an Alaskan Republican, said she was disappointed by the decision. The U.S. Interior Department \"placed significant limits on this season's activities, which resulted in a drilling rig sitting idle,\" she said.\nShell's London-listed shares moved up in early trading but later fell more than 2.8 percent.\nShell said its Alaskan project was valued at about $3 billion on its balance sheet and that it had a $1.1 billion in future contractual commitments. It said it would give an update on the cost of writedowns with third-quarter results.

The firm also cited the recent overhaul of the stamp duty regime and improving housing affordability, in the wake of lower unemployment and rising real wages (adjusted for inflation).\n“These measures have provided stimulus to the overall housing market across the country and the ability for people to invest in improving their homes,” the group said.\nThe new branches will be opened across the company’s Travis Perkins, Wickes, Toolstation and Benchmarx chains. They will be supported by distribution warehouses to be opened or extended in Warrington, Leeds, Northampton, Coventry, Cardiff and Tilbury.\n",

  "articleText" : "Money | Tue Oct 13, 2015 | 1:23pm EDT\nBarclays set to name former JPMorgan banker Staley as new CEO\nBy Lawrence Delevingne and Sinead Cruise | NEW YORK/LONDON\nNEW YORK/LONDON British bank Barclays PLC is close to naming former JPMorgan Chase banker Jes Staley as chief executive, signaling a renewed focus on an investment banking division that has been pared back over the past three years.\nBarclays offered the position to Staley, currently managing partner of U.S. hedge fund firm BlueMountain Capital Management, and he accepted the offer, a person with knowledge of the situation told Reuters.\nBoston-born James 'Jes' Staley, 58, ran JPMorgan's investment bank and asset management business and had been at the bank for 34 years before leaving in early 2013 to join BlueMountain. He made the shortlist when Barclays last looked for a CEO three years ago.\n\"His appointment will indicate a greater commitment to the IB (investment bank), but then Barclays' profitability problems are linked to the IB and not the traditional bank,\" said Chintan Joshi, analyst at Nomura.\nPrevious CEO Antony Jenkins was fired in July after losing the support of non-executive directors in a clash over style and the pace of the bank's turnaround.\nJenkins set about reducing the importance of the investment bank after a series of scandals, while changes in regulation also made many trading activities unprofitable. It was intended as a clear break from his predecessor Bob Diamond, another American investment banker.\nInvestors and analysts said Staley should improve morale and set a clear strategy for the investment bank after years of uncertainty, but they warned he should not build it back up aggressively.\n\"At first sight he would not appear to be the person to downsize the IB, but maybe that is too much of a snap reaction,\" said Richard Marwood, senior investment manager at Axa Investment Managers.A top 20 Barclays investor, who asked not to be named, said: \"We don't have a problem with them retaining some investment banking activities, it just needs to be done in a rational way ... given the volatility and reputational risk that comes with the investment bank, the bar needs to be set very high.\"\nBarclays shares were down 2.6 percent at 249.9 pence by 1340 GMT, underperforming a 2 percent fall by Europe's bank index.\nCHOPPY WATERS\nAny appointment would also still depend on Staley getting approval from Britain's financial regulators.\nThe appointment is expected to be announced in the next two weeks, according to the Financial Times, which first reported the expected hiring.\nA Bank of England spokeswoman said on Tuesday no-one had been approved yet as new Barclays CEO.\nBarclays said it noted the speculation regarding Staley but the process of appointing a new CEO \"has not yet concluded\".\n\"If this change is approved, it could signal that UK and U.S. regulators are comfortable with the renewed ascendancy of investment banking,\" said Jim Antos, analyst at Mizuho Securities Asia in Hong Kong.\nStaley, a keen yachtsman, joined JPMorgan in 1979 and spent eight years in its Brazilian business. He helped found its equities business and later became CEO of asset management.\nHe was long seen as a possible successor to JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, but was sidelined after a management reshuffle in 2012 and moved to BlueMountain a year later.\nStaley will face a number of challenges at Barclays.\nThe bank is just over halfway through a three-year plan to cut 19,000 jobs, including 7,000 in the investment bank, and it still faces litigation issues.\nIt needs to cut costs to improve returns, is trying to wind down 57 billion pounds of non-core assets, and needs to separate its domestic retail bank from more risky activities by 2019 to meet new regulations. Industry sources have said it has had more difficulty finalizing its \"ring-fencing\" plans than rivals.\nStaley, who also previously ran JPMorgan's private banking, may also look to fix Barclays' underperforming wealth management business.\nBarclays Chairman John McFarlane, who has been running the bank since Jenkins' exit, has also put more emphasis back on the investment bank and this week said European investment banks should consider merging to create a regional champion to compete with U.S. rivals, which are gaining market share.\nAn appointment of Staley would see a second former JPMorgan investment bank boss running a British bank, after Standard Chartered this year picked Bill Winters as its new CEO.\nBarclays' Finance Director Tushar Morzaria is another former JPMorgan executive, showing the growing influence of the U.S. bank's alumni in London.\n(Writing by Steve Slater; Additional reporting by Sangameswaran S, Aurindom Mukherjee and Lawrence White; Editing by Mark Potter and Keith Weir)\nJes Staley speaks during a panel discussion at the Institute of International Finance (IIF) annual meeting in Washington September 25, 2011.

REUTERS/Rick Wilking\nWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Friday said it has boosted its holdings in some of the billionaire's favorite companies, including Wells Fargo & Co and International Business Machines Corp.\nThe changes were disclosed in a regulatory filing detailing Berkshire's U.S.-listed stock portfolio as of March 31.\nBerkshire also boosted its share stake in U.S. Bancorp, another large holding, while other portfolio managers adjusted their stakes in several companies.\nNo new stocks were added to the portfolio, which shrank to $107.1 billion from $109.4 billion in December. Berkshire bought $1.62 billion and sold $1.11 billion of equities overall.\nBuffett has long praised his \"Big Four\" stock holdings Wells Fargo, IBM, Coca-Cola Co and American Express Co, which comprise roughly 58 percent of Berkshire's equity investments.\nBuffett has stuck with them despite recent adversity including IBM's stagnant stock price, concern over Coca-Cola's sugary products and executive pay structure, and a February court ruling that American Express violated antitrust law.\n\"Too many fund managers are more interested in seeing stocks to which they have committed perform well\" in the short term, said Andy Kern, a University of Missouri professor who teaches a class on Buffett's investment strategies. \"Berkshire has such a long time horizon that it can afford to watch the stock price go down so it can buy more.\"\nFriday's regulatory filing does not disclose who makes which investment at Berkshire. Smaller investments are often made by portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who may succeed Buffett as chief investment officers after he departs.\nIn the first quarter, Berkshire raised its stake in Wells Fargo by about 2 percent to 470.3 million shares, and in IBM by roughly 3 percent to 79.6 million shares.

  "title" : "How Kraft-Heinz Merger Came Together in Speedy 10 Weeks",
  "articleURL" : "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-25/heinz-kraft",
  "articleText" : "Caricatures of Warren Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway and Charlie Munger, vice chairman, appear on a pair of Heinz ketchup bottles during the Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, on May 3, 2014.\nPhotographer: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg\nShare on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp\nFor a deal that will create the processed-food equivalent of an oil-tanker, the merger of H.J. Heinz and Kraft Foods Group Inc. was turned around at a dizzying speed.\nIn just 10 weeks, starting in mid-January, the two companies agreed to the $46 billion deal, orchestrated by private-equity firm 3G Capital and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which teamed up to buy Heinz a couple years ago.\nThe fact that each side was represented by a single investment-banking firm helped speed the negotiations, according to people familiar with the matter. So did the pressure on Kraft Chief Executive Officer John Cahill to get a deal done -- or see 3G do a transaction with someone else, they said.\n3G told Cahill that Kraft was the best fit, at the same time it made clear it would move on to another food company if the two couldn’t reach an agreement, the people said.\nThe idea of merging Heinz with Kraft was not a new one. 3G had spent months examining a possible bid, exploring where costs could be cut in Kraft’s sprawling cream-cheese-to-coffee empire.\nAt the start of the year, the decision was made to proceed, according to people who provided details on the negotiations, who asked not to be identified discussing private information.\nIn early January, 3G called its tight-knit coterie of advisers, including bankers from Lazard Ltd. and lawyers from Cravath, Swaine & Moore and Kirkland & Ellis. Usually a quiet period for takeovers, some of the advisers were still on holiday. The message was clear: The Brazilian-based private equity firm that has become the world’s most voracious consumer-goods dealmaker was ready to strike again.\nEasy Relationship\nAlex Behring da Costa, 48, a 3G co-founder and Heinz chairman, flew to Chicago and drove the last 15 miles to the nearby suburb of Northfield, Kraft’s home. While it was the first time he had met Cahill, the two men quickly struck up an easy relationship.\nEven at that first meeting, Cahill acknowledged the logic of combining the two companies, and the two agreed to meet again in New York, where they could avoid raising suspicion.\nOver the following weeks, Cahill and senior Kraft executives made frequent trips to 3G’s office to negotiate. Cahill and his team pressed for a big premium to justify shareholders losing control of the company.\nBehring da Costa countered that the need for a substantial premium was lessened because Kraft shareholders would co-own a company controlled by two of the world’s most successful investors, 3G and Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway.\nThere was also the question of how to properly value the merger, complicated by Heinz being a private company.\nCahill Motivation\nAdvisers for Heinz and Kraft settled on valuing Kraft at around $85-$90 a share, said two people who worked on the deal, or about $50 billion in equity value. That number includes the dividend payout of $16.50 per share and then a premium for Kraft shareholders, they said.\nCahill was motivated to do a quick negotiation as well. He had been CEO for only a few weeks, though had served as chairman of Kraft since 2012 and knew the brands intimately.\nAntitrust Concerns\n3G made no secret of wanting to do a mega-deal. Targets ranging from Kellogg Co. to Campbell Soup Co. to Mondelez International Inc., the snack business from which Kraft was spun out, had been speculated about for months. Cahill was aware of the advantage of doing any deal first, or face the prospect of a rival striking a similar transaction later, said one person familiar with the matter.\nAnother factor that allowed the deal to move at such a fast pace was the lack of antitrust concerns, often a sticking point in mergers.\n“Their brands don’t compete, and in mergers of consumer packaged-goods companies, products can be sold easily if regulators are concerned about the loss of competition between any of them,” said Fiona Scott Morton, a former chief economist with the Justice Department’s antitrust division and now at the Yale School of Management.\nThe deal is the first transaction exceeding $10 billion that didn’t include a big bank -- what’s known as a bulge-bracket firm, which dominates the market for M&A advice -- in at least a decade. Centerview Partners LLC served as adviser for Kraft, and Lazard advised Heinz.\n",

  "articleText" : "Persimmon\nPersimmon shares rise as housebuilder shrugs off Brexit vote\nProfits rise 29% in first half of year as firm claims strong customer interest in new homes despite EU referendum result\nA Persimmon building site in Dartford, Kent. Photograph: Neil Hall/Reuters\nTuesday 23 August 2016 11.10 BST\nLast modified on Tuesday 23 August 2016 14.16 BST\nClose\nThis article is 3 months old\nShares in housebuilders have risen after Persimmon , the biggest company in the sector, said the UK vote to leave the EU has not put off potential homebuyers.\nAnnouncing first-half results, Persimmon said trading since the 23 June referendum had been strong and that after a short period of wariness customer interest had increased from a year earlier.\nAlong with other housebuilders, Persimmon’s shares fell after the referendum result amid fears that falling consumer confidence and an economic slowdown would dent the housing market . Countrywide, Britain’s biggest estate agent, predicted this week that average prices would fall 1% next year before rising again .\nNicholas Wrigley, Persimmon’s chairman, said: “While the result of the EU referendum has created increased uncertainty, the news was quickly digested by our customers. Customer interest since then has been robust with a strengthening of visitor numbers to our sites compared to the same period last year.”\nCustomer cancellations for viewings rose slightly in the week following the referendum but they are now running slightly lower than a year ago, Wrigley added.\nAfter dropping 37% on 24 June to £13.10, Persimmon shares have regained most of the loss and were the biggest risers in the FTSE 100 following its upbeat statement, rising almost 5% to £18.77 in early trading. Rival housebuilders Taylor Wimpey, Barratt and Berkeley were also among the index’s top 10 gainers.\nPersimmon’s pre-tax profit rose 29% to £352m in the six months to the end of June as revenue rose 12% to 1.3bn. Housebuilders have boomed over the past few years supported by rising prices, economic growth and the government’s help-to-buy scheme.\nFinance director Mike Killoran said that after the traditionally quiet summer months Persimmon expected business to pick up in the autumn and that potential customers had their finances in place to buy.\nKilloran added: “Given the interest we are seeing on the sites from visitor traffic and people genuinely wanting to buy we can see no reason why we wouldn’t see that [autumn] seasonality continue. All the feedback we are getting from sites is that given the market we are in and the product we are offering … there is a great desire to buy.”\n",

Financial terms were not disclosed.\n“It’s a sensible bit of tidying up,” said Wyn Ellis, an analyst at Numis Securities. Diageo can reinvest the proceeds from a sale elsewhere, Ellis said, noting that the company’s main priorities are returning its U.S. division to growth and reducing excess inventory held by wholesalers.\nGleneagles, a luxury resort and golf venue in the county of Perth, Scotland, was acquired by Diageo in 1984 and has been a target for divestment since 1998, according to The Times newspaper. In 2001, Diageo rejected an informal 90 million-pound ($141 million) offer for the property, it said.\nIn addition to last year’s Ryder Cup, the hotel is the venue for Diageo’s annual Johnnie Walker Championship golf tournament and has hosted political gatherings including the Bilderberg Conference and the G8 summit.\nThe hotel had operating profit of 2.6 million pounds and sales of 43.5 million pounds in the 12 months through June 2014.\n“Following the success of the Ryder Cup we feel this is an appropriate time to realize value,” Diageo Chief Executive Officer Ivan Menezes said in the statement.\nAnother possible candidate for divestment is the company’s wine business. Diageo said this year it has reviewed expressions of interest for the unit, which includes Blossom Hill and Yellow Tail.\n“A sale of the wine business is undoubtedly a possibility,” Numis’s Ellis said. “There’s a bit of tidying up left to do in the portfolio.”\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

He had originally been expected to be released in January next year.\nThe case was intertwined with an investigation of GSK in China which rocked the country's pharmaceutical market and led to a $489 million fine against the firm last year for paying bribes to doctors to use its drugs.\nHumphrey is in a Shanghai hospital undergoing tests and the British consulate is processing an emergency passport for him, so he can be deported once he is released from hospital, the source said.\nIt was not clear when Humphrey would officially be released. Yu, who was sentenced to two years in jail, will be freed in coming weeks.\n\"We have been notified by the Chinese authorities that a British national detained in China has been released. We are providing consular assistance to the family,\" a spokesman for the British consulate in Shanghai said.\nHumphrey and Yu, who ran risk consultancy ChinaWhys, had been asked by GSK to compile a report into the origins of a sex video involving its former China head Mark Reilly, which had been sent to senior executives at the British firm along with anonymous emails alleging corruption.\nOn July 10, 2013, Chinese authorities detained Humphrey and Yu. Days later police accused GSK of funnelling up to 3 billion yuan ($482 million) through travel agencies to bribe doctors and officials in China.\nA UK-based spokesman for GSK declined to comment on the reports that the couple are to be freed. Two lawyers who acted for Humphrey and Yu last year said they were not aware of the decision.\nPresident Xi Jinping will travel to Britain for a state visit in October, 10 years after the last such visit by a Chinese president.

  "articleText" : "Follow\nOil slumped to below $28 a barrel in early morning trading on Monday - its lowest level since September 2003 - as traders digested news of Iran's return to the world's over-supplied markets.\nBrent crude shed 1.3pc to fall as low as $27.70 before rebounding by more than 2pc to $29.\nThe slide came after Opec said persistently low prices would finally begin to bite for rival producers in 2016, forcing the US and Canada to cut back on production this year.\n• Don't fear the oil price crash - unless it heralds a global downturn\nIn its latest monthly review of the oil market , the group said non-Opec supply would shrink by 660,000 barrels a day this year, above previous estimates of just 270,000.\nThe forecast seemingly vindicates the cartel's landmark decision to ramp up production in order steal a march on higher cost producers such as US shale.\nBut shale drillers, as well as producers in Canada and Russia have proven resilient in the face of the 18-month price crash - which is now the worst in the post-war era. Non-Opec production grew by more than expected in 2015 to 1.23m barrels a day, said the report, which predicted that 2016 was finally the year markets began to rebalance.\nOil prices have collapsed by 75pc since the summer of 2014. Record stockpiles have also put pressure on the world's storage capacity, forcing prices into negative territory in some parts of the US. One major US refiner - Flint Hill Resources - said it would now charge producers -$0.50 a barrel for North Dakota South - a variant of crude.\nSaudi Arabia has led the charge in maintaining output, producing 10.25 million barrels a day in December, a hike of 750,000 barrels a day from the end of last year.\nAnalysts said the price rout is expected to deepen as Iran has vowed to pump an additional 500,000 barrels a day following the formal lifting of its sanctions over the weekend.\nInternational companies are now free to invest in the Islamic Republic's oil resources as the ban on currency conversions is lifted and Iranian oil is available to purchase on international markets.\n\"Independent oil companies are highly interested in low-cost oil assets,\" said Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB.\n\"On the other side, Iran has indicated highly favourable investment terms for international oil companies.\"\nBut Tehran's need for huge investment in its oil industry means an immediate expansion of its production to pre-sanction levels is not yet on the cards, said Al Stanton at RBC.\nIran has resisted calls from Saudi Arabia to hold back on production in a bid to stabilise the glutted oil market. The rift saw Opec fail to agree on a formal production target for the first time in its recent history in December.\nSaudi oil minister Ali al-Naimi said he was \"optimistic\" that major producers would eventually come together to help rebalance the market.\n“Market forces as well as the co-operation among producing nations always lead to the restoration of stability. This, however, takes some time,\" Mr al-Naimi said on Monday.\nSaudi Arabia's oil minister Ali al-Naimi\nOman, which is the largest Gulf producer to sit outside Opec, said it was ready to co-operate and cut back on production if other nations also relented, according to its oil minister, Mohammed Al-Rumhy.\nOpec said it expected oil demand to pick up this year, revising up estimates by 1.7m to 31.6m barrels a day.\nMajor producers are currently over-supplying markets by 2-2.5 million barrels a day, said Stuart Gulliver, chief executive of HSBC.\nMr Gulliver said he expected prices to stabilise at between $25 and $40 in a year's time.\nA barrel of Brent is now likely to fall below $25 this year, according to the latest odds from Ladbrokes. The bookies have 10/11 on oil falling below $25, and 10/1 for a collapse to $10.\n",

On a constant currency basis, revenue was down 22%.\nOperating profit fell 42% to £259m, with Weir's operating margin down 490 basis points to 13.5%. Its profit before tax was down 46% to £220m. The company had £365m of operating exceptional costs during the year, including a £225m impairment in Oil & Gas.\nEarnings per share were down 45% to 78.4p. Weir Group's final dividend was announced at 29p, leaving the year's total dividend unchanged at 44p.\n\"Despite market challenges which are unprecedented in recent years, Weir has delivered a resilient performance in Minerals, maintained leadership and market share in Oil & Gas, and created an additional platform for growth with the new Flow Control division,\" said chief executive Keith Cochrane.\n\"As Weir has always done, we adapted quickly to market conditions. Costs were aggressively reduced while the cash generative nature of the business supported continued investment in our strategic priorities,\" he added.\nThe company said it saw continued resilience in Minerals, with aftermarket revenues stable, and a sequential input decline in Oil & Gas, which was in line with market conditions.\nWeir's Power & Industrial division reportedly saw improved profitability, despite what the board described as challenging markets.\nThe board said it was aggressively responding to market conditions, with cost reductions of £110m delivered in annualised savings in 2015, and an additional cost reduction programme of £40m in 2016.\nWeir Group also saw strong cash generation, with free cash flow up 67% to £132m. Net debt was also reduced by £36m, despite a £48m foreign exchange headwind, and the company said up to £100m would be realised from the disposal of non-core assets in the 2016 year.\n\"Given ongoing market conditions, 2016 will be another challenging year. As a result, we are planning for a further reduction in constant currency Group operating profits, driven primarily by lower activity levels in upstream oil and gas markets,\" Cochrane said.\n\"We will continue to invest for the medium term supported by our aftermarket-focused business model, further cost reduction initiatives, non-core asset disposals and a clear focus on cash generation, to ensure we benefit fully and quickly when markets improve,\" he explained.\n",

REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo\nBy Huw Jones and Andreas Kröner | LONDON/FRANKFURT\nLONDON/FRANKFURT Shareholders of the London Stock Exchange will vote on Monday on whether to back a $27 billion merger with Deutsche Boerse, even though the deal may have to be tweaked following Britain's decision to leave the European Union.\nThe two exchanges have insisted that their all-share merger to create the world's biggest bourse by revenue was essentially \"Brexit proof\", but the result of Britain's June 23 referendum has cast a shadow over the deal.\nGermany's markets watchdog BaFin said last week that London could not host the headquarters of the planned European stock exchange giant if London is outside the bloc, saying it would be hard to imagine that the most important exchange in the euro zone would be steered from a headquarters outside the EU.\nShareholders of the 318-year old London exchange will vote at 0915 GMT on Monday on what is London's third attempt to merge with Deutsche Boerse in 16 years, the previous plans scuppered by a band of British stockbrokers, and a failed counterbid from Stockholm's bourse.\nThe results of the vote will be announced later on Monday.\nSources close to the deal have said they expect LSE shareholders to approve the merger.\nDeutsche Boerse shareholders are being asked to approve the tender offer in a postal vote that will be completed by July 12.\nRegulatory approval is seen as a major hurdle. While BaFin cannot veto the deal, its concerns are likely to be taken seriously by Deutsche Boerse - and by the German state of Hesse, where Deutsche Boerse is based. The state of Hesse has a veto power, along with the EU's competition unit.\nThe London Stock Exchange Group, which comprises the London exchange, Borsa Italiana in Milan and LCH.Clearnet, Europe's biggest off-exchange derivatives clearing house, had no comment.\nWhen the Brexit vote result was announced on June 24, the London exchange said the deal would go ahead as planned without any changes to the terms.\nDeutsche Boerse had no comment.\nHowever, financial markets fell sharply on news of Brexit, sending sterling down to 30-year lows. That makes the 54:46 percent split between Deutsche Boerse and the London exchange far more favorable to the latter's shareholders as they would get the same number of Deutsche Boerse shares despite the pound's slump in value.\nThe two exchanges had already set up a committee to study the impact of Britain's referendum on the merger. It is headed by Deutsche Boerse Chairman Joachim Faber, who has said the choice of London as the sole headquarters of the holding company would have to be reviewed in the case of a Brexit.\nIt is unclear whether Britain would allow the combined group's head office to be in Frankfurt rather than London.\nThe committee is due to meet in coming weeks and could make non-binding recommendations.\nIt's not just the head office location that is likely to be discussed. The shape of Britain's future trading relations with the EU, which may take months or years to fully emerge, would also have commercial implications for the deal.\nThe British government has signaled that it won't formally inform the EU of the country's intention to leave the bloc until after the summer. Without this step, a two-year period to negotiate the divorce under the EU's Lisbon Treaty cannot begin.\nRegulators are likely to want to see any recommendations before they make a ruling on the merger, and major changes to the deal could need further shareholder approval, people familiar with the process told Reuters.\n(Reporting by Huw Jones; Editing by Susan Fenton)\nNext In Deals\n",

The Orphan Drug Designation programme provides orphan status to drugs and biologics, which are defined as those intended for the safe and effective treatment, diagnosis or prevention of rare diseases or disorders that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the US, it added.\n\"Uveal melanoma is a rare and devastating disease for which there are currently no effective treatment options once it spreads beyond the tissues of the eye. Selumetinib could potentially become the first effective treatment for these patients. The Orphan Drug Designation is an important regulatory advancement as we further our development plans for selumetinib in uveal melanoma,\" said Antoine Yver, AstraZeneca's head of oncology in its global medicines development unit.\nData from its ongoing study of AZD9291 in patients with advanced epidermal growth factor receptor mutation positive non-small cell lung cancer who also have the T790M resistance mutation has shown a delay in disease progression of over a year, the company said.\nThe data showed a media progression free survival of 13.5 months. It also showed an overall response rate with AZD9291 80 milligrams of 54%, with a median duration of response of 12.4 months.\nAstraZeneca said it was on track for regulatory submission of AZD9291 in the US in the second quarter of 2015.\nShares in AstraZeneca are trading up 0.4% at 4,849.50 pence Friday morning.\nBy Sam Unsted; samunsted@alliancenews.com; @SamUAtAlliance.

  "articleText" : "Get business updates directly to your inbox\n+ Subscribe\nThank you for subscribing!\nCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email\nShares in Weir Group rose almost eight per cent on Thursday on reports it expects first-half profits will be “slightly ahead of market expectations” despite a 21 per cent drop in first quarter input.\nThe Glasgow-based pump maker said the primary driver for the dip in input in the period to April 27 was the result of lower activity levels across the oil and gas sector.\nHowever, the group notes a further £10 million of “incremental annualised cost savings” was achieved in the first quarter, taking the savings run-rate from actions taken in the past 18-months to £160 million.\nWeir said overall, original equipment orders were down 11 per cent and aftermarket orders were down 25 per cent on the same period in 2015, but were “both slightly up on a sequential basis”.\nOn a like for like basis, excluding its £30 million acquisition of Delta Valves in July 2015, overall order input fell 22 per cent in Q1, with original equipment down 13 per cent and aftermarket down 25 per cent.\nWeir said revenues in the first quarter of 2016 were “in line with expectations and lower than the first quarter of 2015, primarily as a result of reduced oil and gas activity levels”.\nMargins are also reported to be lower than the prior year, largely as a result of lower oil and gas division margins.\nWeir said in North America, its oil and gas division's biggest end market, “approximately 70 per cent” of its frack fleet is now idle.\nThe group notes the US rig count declined by nearly 20 per cent in the past two months and “market expectations are for a 46 per cent reduction in wells drilled in 2016”, which Weir said will “further reduced demand for pressure pumping and pressure control equipment”.\nAs a result of market conditions, Weir said revenues from the Oil & Gas division were “materially lower” in the first quarter and operating markets “fell slightly below break-even reflecting on-going pricing pressure and negative operating leverage from lower volumes, partially offset by incremental cost saving measures”.\nWeir adds: “The continued declines in activity levels mean that, while visibility remains low, a slower than previously anticipated recovery through 2016 is now anticipated with slightly lower full year constant currency revenue expectations as a result.\n“Operating margins will be further impacted by negative operational leverage, with an expectation that profitability of the division will improve modestly in the second half.”\nIn Minerals, Weir said first quarter order output was down four per cent on a “strong prior year” and down five per cent like for like but up “significantly on a sequential basis and slightly ahead of prior expectations”.\nOriginal equipment input was up 15 per cent on last year, “supported by a good contribution from Delta Valves”, and up 11 per cent on a like for like basis.\nAftermarket input from Minerals was down 11 per cent on “both a reported and on a like for like basis”, the group said.\nHowever Weir said despite market conditions, constant currency like for like revenues from Minerals in the first quarter “were in line with the prior year” and “slightly ahead” of prior expectations as orders increased.\nWeir said first quarter profits from minerals “were ahead of prior expectations as a result of strong cost control with the full year outlook underpinned by a further £10 million of incremental annualised cost savings identified and actioned in the second quarter.”\nIn Flow Control, order output was down 20 per cent in the first quarter on last year, with original equipment orders down 28 per cent and aftermarket orders down 10 per cent, as “economic uncertainty led to continued customer caution and project delays across the division's end markets”, Weir said.\nChief executive Keith Cochrane said: “The Group has maintained its focus on strong cash generation, aggressive cost reduction and developing the innovative solutions which have made Weir a global leader.\n“This comes against the backdrop of ongoing challenges across our end markets.\n\"Mining customers continue to prioritise preserving cash, although there was a slight pickup in orders through the quarter and Minerals divisional revenues on a like for like basis were flat year on year.\n“Trading conditions in oil and gas markets reflected further reductions in activity levels in all regions despite the limited improvement in oil prices in 2016.\n“The Group remains focused on cost reduction measures which have helped to deliver first quarter profits slightly ahead of our expectations.\n\"As a result, we expect first half profits to be slightly ahead of market expectations.\n“Our full year expectations remain unchanged, reflecting the slower recovery now anticipated in oil and gas markets.”\nIn February Weir Group reported a £200 million pre-tax loss for the 2015 year after taking £365 million in exceptional charges and £92 million in one-off costs, having shed 1,600 jobs globally in a year, including 40 per cent of its North American workforce.\nLike us on Facebook\n",

  "articleText" : "Glencore Sells Agriculture Unit Stake for $2.5 Billion\nCanada's largest pension fund to acquire 40% holding in unit\nGlencore is selling assets to help curb $25.9 billion of debt\nShare on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp\nCanada’s largest pension fund agreed to pay $2.5 billion for a minority stake in Glencore Plc’s agriculture unit as the commodity trader and miner works to reduce its debt burden.\nCanada Pension Plan Investment Board will acquire a 40 percent stake in the division which handles wheat, corn, barley, biofuels, cotton and sugar, according to a statement on Wednesday. The deal places an equity value on the entire business at $6.25 billion. Citigroup Inc. valued it at $10.5 billion in September last year.\nThe price “was the low end of our valuation range, but it is not necessarily a disappointment,” said Ben Davis, an analyst at Liberum Capital Ltd. in London who advises holding the shares. “Cash through the door remains key for Glencore.”\nThe sale is part of a\ndebt -cutting program Glencore Chief Executive Officer Ivan Glasenberg unveiled last year in a move to mitigate concern about the company’s capacity to pay down $30 billion of debt as commodity prices tumbled. Canada Pension fended off\nother bidders that included Asian and Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds and the state-owned Saudi Agricultural and Livestock Investment Co.\nStock Retreats\nGlencore shares slipped 1.2 percent to close 140.10 pence in London. The company’s 588 million euros of notes maturing in April 2021 rose 1.8 cents on the euro to 93 cents, the highest since September, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. \nThe price “is lower than market expectations based on discussions with investors,” Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analyst Eugene King, who has a hold rating on the stock, wrote in a note to clients. The cash will help lower debt, but it will have minimal impact on the critical net debt to Ebitda ratio assessed by ratings agencies, he said.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. described the transaction as a “solid but not spectacular outcome” while Bank of America Merrill Lynch called it “better than expected.”\nGlencore has an option to sell as much as 20 percent more in the business. Both Glencore and CPPIB can call for an initial public offering after eight years from the deal closing, expected to be in the second half of this year.\nMark Jenkins, the global head of private investments at Canada Pension, said he expected another partner to acquire the additional 20 percent stake in the near term.\nOther Partners\n\"It’s to their benefit to have other relationships,\" Jenkins said in an interview. \"We think we’re a great partner, and we’re going to be a great partner going forward. But there’s always value in bringing a bit of diversity around the table.\"\nCanada Pension has expanded into agriculture over the past three years by acquiring farmland in the U.S. and Canada, Jenkins said. The industry provides stable, long-term returns and exposure to global trends of population growth and the rising middle class, he said. The new stake provides an opportunity to expand in agriculture and add to Glencore’s business through acquisitions, particularly in the U.S. and Australia, according to Jenkins.\nFood Trading\nGlencore became a major agriculture player when it agreed to buy Canadian grain handler Viterra Inc. for C$6.1 billion ($4.6 billion) in 2012. With global network of more than 200 storage facilities and 23 ports, the company buys products from farmers, processors and other suppliers and sells to customers including local importers and government agencies.\nThe unit has gross assets of $10.2 billion and generated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $734 million last year.\nAs the commodity collapse intensified in 2015, Glencore fought to reduce its debt burden, which totaled $25.9 billion at the end of last year, by scrapping its dividend, closed mines and sold $2.5 billion of new shares. Last month, the company pledged to cut net debt to as low as $17 billion and raise as much as $5 billion from selling assets.\n“CPPIB have a proven track record in the sector and share our vision for the future growth of the business through value-creating organic and inorganic growth opportunities,” Glasenberg said in the statement.\nAg Deals\nThe transaction caps three years of intense deal making in the agriculture industry. Last year, Mitsubishi Corp. paid just over $1 billion for a 20 percent stake in food trader Olam International Ltd. Marubeni Corp., one of Japan’s top-five trading houses, bought U.S. grain merchant Gavilon Holdings LLC for $2.7 billion plus debt in 2013.\nCofco Corp., China’s largest food company, spent more than $4 billion over two years to build a global grain trader. It acquired the grains and oilseeds unit of Noble Group Ltd. and a majority stake in Dutch trader Nidera BV.\nGlencore’s agriculture business “is now well-placed to take advantage of the significant opportunities that are expected to emerge across the sector in the coming years,” Mark Jenkins, senior managing director and global head of private investments at CPPIB, said in the statement. Agriculture is an “excellent fit” for a long term investor, he said.\nBarclays Plc, Citigroup Inc. and Credit Suisse Group AG were joint financial advisers to Glencore. CPPIB was advised by Deutsche Bank AG.\nPeter Grauer, chairman of Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, is a senior independent non-executive director at Glencore.\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

  "articleText" : "FDA Advisory Committee reviews SAVOR outcomes study results for ONGLYZA® (saxagliptin) and KOMBIGLYZE® XR (saxagliptin and metformin HCI extended-release)\nPUBLISHED 14 April 2015\nTuesday, 14 April 2015\nAstraZeneca today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee (EMDAC) voted 13 to 1 (1 abstained; 15 total votes) that the results of the Saxagliptin Assessment of Vascular Outcomes Recorded in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus (SAVOR) study demonstrated that the use of saxagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes has an acceptable cardiovascular risk profile. In addition, 14 out of 15 Committee members recommended that the FDA supplement the products’ labeling to add new safety information, with one vote to withdraw saxagliptin from the market.\nAstraZeneca will also conduct further investigation to better understand the signal of hospitalisation for heart failure found in the SAVOR results.\nThe Advisory Committee was asked to consider data from SAVOR, a large, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled postmarketing study designed to evaluate the cardiovascular effects of ONGLYZA when added to current type 2 diabetes background therapy in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus at risk for cardiovascular disease.\nSAVOR met the primary safety objective, demonstrating that ONGLYZA did not increase the risk for cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal ischemic stroke when added to a patient’s current standard of care, with or without other antidiabetic therapies, as compared to placebo. The supplemental New Drug Applications (sNDAs) based on the SAVOR results, if approved, will provide prescribers and patients important additional information about the benefit-risk profile of ONGLYZA and KOMBIGLYZE XR.\nThe Advisory Committee was convened to discuss previously submitted sNDAs to the FDA for ONGLYZA and KOMBIGLYZE XR. The FDA is not bound by the Advisory Committee's recommendation but takes its advice into consideration when reviewing these sNDAs. AstraZeneca remains committed to working closely with the FDA to support further review of these sNDAs.\nNOTES FOR EDITORS\nAbout SAVOR\nThe SAVOR (Saxagliptin Assessment of Vascular Outcomes Recorded in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus) clinical trial of ONGLYZA (saxagliptin) was a large, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase IV study in patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk of cardiovascular disease, designed and conducted in accordance with the 2008 FDA guidance, “Diabetes Mellitus – Evaluating Cardiovascular Risk in New Antidiabetic Therapies to Treat Type 2 Diabetes.” The primary objective of this trial was to determine that the addition of saxagliptin to standard of care in this patient population did not significantly increase the incidence of major cardiovascular events as compared to placebo.\nSAVOR met the primary safety objective, demonstrating that ONGLYZA did not increase the risk for cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI and nonfatal ischaemic stroke when added to a patient’s current standard of care (with or without other antidiabetic therapies), as compared to placebo (613 patients [3.7 per 100 person-years] in the ONGLYZA group compared with 609 patients [3.7 per 100 person-years] in the placebo group (Hazard Ratio [HR]: 1.00; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.89, 1.12; non-inferiority p-value < 0.001; superiority p-value = 0.99]). ONGLYZA did not meet the primary efficacy objective of superiority to placebo for the same composite endpoint. For the secondary endpoint of nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, cardiovascular death, hospitalisation for heart failure (hHF), hospitalisation for unstable angina, or hospitalisation for coronary revascularization, no statistically significant treatment differences were observed between ONGLYZA and placebo (HR 1.02 [95% CI 0.94, 1.11]; nominal p=0.66 for a difference between the 2 treatment groups). However, an increased risk for hHF, a component of the balanced secondary endpoint, was observed with ONGLYZA treatment. The analysis showed a numerical imbalance with more events on ONGLYZA (HR 1.27 [95% CI 1.07, 1.51]; nominal p=0.007). This finding was most relevant for patients at increased risk for heart failure (HF), such as those with a history of HF or renal impairment, and is manageable in the context of the routine care of patients at risk for HF. The other secondary endpoint of the SAVOR study was all-cause mortality. The analysis showed a numerical imbalance with more events on ONGLYZA (HR 1.11 [95% CI 0.96, 1.27]; nominal p=0.154). The results of the evaluation of all-cause mortality indicate that there was no excess mortality attributable to saxagliptin in the SAVOR study.\nAbout DPP-4 inhibitors\nSaxagliptin belongs to the class of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. Incretin hormones decrease elevated blood sugar levels (glucose) by increasing the body’s utilisation of sugar, mainly through increasing insulin production in the pancreas, and by reducing the liver’s production of glucose. DPP-4 inhibitors work by increasing the activity of the incretin hormones, increasing the release of insulin when glucose levels are elevated and reducing the levels of sugar produced by the liver.\nAbout Type 2 Diabetes\nDiabetes is estimated to affect 29.1 million people in the US and more than 382 million people worldwide. The prevalence of diabetes is projected to reach more than 592 million people worldwide by 2035. Type 2 diabetes accounts for approximately 90-95 percent of all cases of diagnosed diabetes in the US. Type 2 diabetes is a chronic disease characterised by pathophysiologic defects leading to elevated glucose levels. Significant unmet needs still exist, as many patients remain inadequately controlled on their current glucose-lowering regimen. It is estimated that more than half of people living with type 2 diabetes are not achieving recommended HbA1c goals based on guidelines established by professional societies and advocacy organisations for diabetes management.\nAbout AstraZeneca in Diabetes\nAstraZeneca is pushing the boundaries of science to create life-changing medicines to reduce the burden and complications of diabetes. Our comprehensive diabetes portfolio provides treatment options to patients throughout the different stage of their disease, supporting them to reach treatment goals with a mono or combination therapies. As a core strategic area for the company, we are focusing our research and development efforts in diverse populations and patients with significant co-morbidities, such as cardiovascular disease, heart failure, obesity, NASH, and chronic kidney disease. Our research efforts are also targeting the regeneration of pancreatic cells aiming to address the underlying cause of the disease. In partnership with diabetes professional and patient societies and associations, AstraZeneca is contributing to solutions supporting prevention, awareness, diagnosis, professional education and advance care for diabetic patients.\nAbout AstraZeneca\nAstraZeneca is a global, innovation-driven biopharmaceutical business that focuses on the discovery, development and commercialisation of prescription medicines, primarily for the treatment of cardiovascular, metabolic, respiratory, inflammation, autoimmune, oncology, infection and neuroscience diseases.

  "articleText" : "Shell’s $70 Billion BG Deal Meets Shareholder Skepticism\nJavier Blas and Rakteem Katakey\nApril 8, 2015 — 7:00 PM EDT\nUpdated on\nShare on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp\nThe biggest deal in Royal Dutch Shell Plc’s history failed to win over many investors who worry the $70 billion price tag is too high and could imperil their dividend.\nWhile the cash-and-shares purchase of BG Group Plc will make Europe’s largest oil company the preeminent player in global natural gas and add enormous fields in Brazil, it’s not expected to boost earnings per share until 2017 and relies on a quick rebound in crude to about $90 a barrel to ensure success.\nThe shares being used to buy BG fell the most since 2008 on Wednesday even as Shell Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden sought to woo investors by promising cost savings of $2.5 billion and a $25 billion stock buyback.\n“To assume that Shell can pay a 50 percent premium for BG, and extract significant synergies, deliver value for shareholders and maintain a dividend on an expanded shareholder base would require a more-than-healthy degree of optimism,” said Michael Hulme, commodities fund manager at Carmignac Gestion SA.\nShell’s dividend, which accounts for about 10 percent of the total payout to U.K. equity investors, is a particular concern, according to Henderson Global Investors, which owns Shell shares.\n“Shell is taking on more risk and is issuing more shares and also paying out cash to BG shareholders,” Matthew Beesley, Henderson’s global head of equities, said in a note. “And this potentially puts some strain on the dividend as they redirect cash flows to paying down debt ahead of growing the dividend.”\nDilute Earnings\nThe deal will dilute earnings per share by 7.1 percent in 2016, according research from Bloomberg Intelligence, which said the rationale for the merger depended on a rebound in oil prices. The management’s forecast of cash flow for the combined company was based on oil averaging $90 a barrel in 2018.\nShell, which helped pioneer the process of liquefying gas for shipment aboard tankers decades ago, is betting liquefied natural gas will play an increasing role in emerging economies seeking alternatives to dirtier energy sources such as coal.\nThe fundamental logic of a merger “always existed, what has happened in the last month is that it has become very compelling from a value perspective,” Van Beurden said on a conference call on Wednesday.\nThe acquisition will make Shell the dominant global LNG company, and gas is a “very important” component of the deal, he said.\nDeep Water\nBuying BG also brings Shell, based in The Hague, a share in Brazil’s largest deep-water fields, consolidates its position in Australia’s gas industry and allows more participation in the U.S.’s emergence as an LNG exporter.\nShell will pay 383 pence in cash and 0.4454 of its B shares for each BG share, the companies said on Wednesday. That was equal to about 1,367 pence a share based on prices before the deal was announced. That valued BG at about 47 billion pounds and offered a premium of about 50 percent on BG’s pre-deal price.\nShell’s B shares dropped 8.6 percent in London on Wednesday, the biggest decline since 2008.\nWhile a slump of more than 5 percent in benchmark crude prices led other stocks in the industry to decline, Shell led losses among producers worth more than $50 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Exxon Mobil Corp., the second-biggest loser in the group, fell 2 percent.\nShell stock traded little changed on Thursday at 2,022 pence.\nShell management met investors on Wednesday to persuade them that the long-term benefits of the deal outweighed the immediate financial burden and some fund managers were receptive.\nDividend Policy\n“It’s a good deal for BG shareholders, clearly, but also good for shareholders in Royal Dutch Shell,” said Michael Clark, portfolio manager at the Fidelity MoneyBuilder Dividend Fund. “There is no danger that Shell will change its dividend policy.”\nShell snaring BG disrupts the prevailing view among analysts and bankers who had expected merger activity in the industry to remain quiescent until later this year or even 2016.\nThe tie-up could presage a repetition of the wave of deals a decade-and-a-half ago that rocked the oil patch and created today’s so-called supermajors through deals that saw BP Plc buy Amoco Corp. and the creation of Exxon.\nShell was advised by Bank of America Merrill Lynch and BG worked with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Robey Warshaw LLP.\nBreak Fee\nThe agreement includes a break fee of 750 million pounds and the deal is expected to complete in early 2016.\nThe combination will form an LNG giant with sales of about 50 million tons by the end of this decade, Shell Chief Financial Officer Simon Henry said. That would make it twice as big as its closest rival Exxon.\nThe scope of the deal means Shell will require antitrust approvals from regulatory agencies in Australia, China, Brazil and the European Union.\n“We will need their support,” Henry said. “It’s difficult to say now if we expect any issues.”\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

  "articleText" : "£14.14+116p\nQuestor says BUY\nMONDI [LON:MNDI] shares jumped 10pc yesterday after the international packaging group revealed a strong start to the year, with higher demand and lower costs.\nQuestor readers who invested in the group have seen their stock gain £2.64 per share in less than four months, after we picked the shares on January 25 when they were at £11.50 . The rise came after the company benefited from the latest round of quantitative easing by the European Central Bank, and we think there is more to come in the year ahead.\nThe FTSE 100-listed, Africa-based packaging giant said steady demand, and falling prices for the wood, energy and chemicals needed to make packaging and paper, have helped lower costs.\nThe weaker euro and stronger dollar have also boosted results, as the selling price in the single currency is more attractive overseas, while earnings in the greenback are worth more when translated back for reporting.\nOverall, first-quarter profits are expected to be €236m (£171m), up from €183m at the same stage last year, and 9pc higher than the fourth-quarter profits.\nThe outlook for the rest of the year has also improved. Mondi said it had been able to increase the prices of its products across southern Europe and expects to raise them further in other areas later in the year. A recovery in the Russian rouble and higher selling prices for products in that country and South Africa also helped sales.\nMondi generates about 60pc of its total revenue by providing boxes to consumer giants such as Procter & Gamble, Nestle and Unilever to get their washing powder, toothpaste and tinned goods on supermarket shelves. The sector is also enjoying growing demand for packaging on goods ordered over the internet.\nOn the back of the confident update, Justin Jordan, an analyst at broker Jefferies, raised his pre-tax profit forecasts for the year to December to €791m, up from a previous expectation of €740m.\nMr Jordan also said the strong cash generation and balance sheet meant the company could fund special dividends or a share buyback to boost investor returns.\nIn the past four years Mondi has more than doubled its dividend and profits. It has one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector, with net debts of €1.6bn against shareholder equity of €2.9bn. This strength gives the company room to increase payouts to investors, as the dividends are covered more than twice by earnings and cash generation. Mondi is reaping the benefits from spending more than €3bn over the past decade on modernising its factories across eastern Europe to make them more efficient.\nDavid Hathorn, chief executive, said he expects to spend a further €550m in 2015 and 2016, but added that the cash the company generates from selling its products far outweighs the maintenance and capital investment costs.\nMondi shares are dual-listed in South Africa and London, and this will no doubt put off some investors. However, Questor thinks they remain an attractive prospect.\nMondi has a number of uses for its spare cash, one of which could be tobuy smaller rivals. This would accelerate the already impressive revenue growth, and packaging sector experts say the European market is ripe for consolidation.\nIf there are no attractive deals to be done, Mr Hathorn said he has no problem returning cash to investors. Questor likes a company that uses its own cash to fund investment in its factories and pay growing dividends.\nThe shares remain attractive, trading on 14.5 times forecast earnings and offering a prospective dividend yield of 2.5pc. The company is enjoying strong pricing for its products and falling costs.\nWe remain buyers for the long term.\n",

  "articleURL" : "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/rio-tinto-swings-to-loss-drops-dividend-policy-2016-02-11",
  "articleText" : "Published: Feb 11, 2016 3:59 a.m. ET\nShare\nBy\nRhiannonHoyle\nSYDNEY--Rio Tinto PLC scrapped its dividend policy after slumping to an annual loss, effectively conceding it had misread the strength of China's commodities demand and the potential returns from aggressively expanding iron-ore production from Australia to Canada in recent years.\nRio Tinto said it could no longer justify its commitment to maintaining or steadily increasing its dividend each year at a time when the outlook for the global economy is worsening and when prices for many commodities that it produces such as iron ore and coal are at multiyear lows.\nIn a blow for investors who supported years of heavy investment in new mines, especially in Australia's remote Pilbara region, Rio Tinto said this year's annual dividend could be roughly half the US$2.15-a-share payout declared for 2015.\nRio's slashing of its dividend signals plenty of pain to come for global miners as they report earnings in the coming weeks. Although the Anglo-Australian miner's shares have slumped in recent months, it had been seen as a relatively strong performer compared with rivals such as BHP Billiton Ltd., Anglo American PLC and Glencore PLC.\nBHP is due to announce results on Feb. 23, and is widely expected to have to follow its chief rival Rio by abandoning its aim of maintaining or steadily growing its annual payout.\n\"This signals a dramatic change in both the outlook for the company and the industry,\" said Citigroup in a note on Rio's results. \"It does, however, align the dividend policy to cash flow of the business.\"\nRio Tinto also reported a net loss of US$866 million for 2015 on Thursday, compared with a US$6.53 billion profit a year earlier. The result was weighed by impairment charges totaling US$1.8 billion against its Simandou iron-ore project in Guinea and uranium assets in Australia and Canada, as well as US$3.3 billion in foreign exchange and derivatives losses.\nUnderlying earnings, a measure tracked by analysts that strips out some one-time costs, fell 51% to US$4.54 billion.\nBehind Rio Tinto's troubles lies the slowdown in growth in China, especially in its key manufacturing and construction industries. China buys three in every five tons of iron ore traded by sea to make steel, and relies on Australia for most of its imports.\nThree years ago, Rio Tinto had been forecasting that China would need at least 70 million metric tons more iron ore a year through 2020 to feed its industrialization. That compares with Rio Tinto's annual iron-ore output of around 350 million tons.\nRio has spent billions of dollars expanding its mines and output in recent years. But it could earn less from its key iron-ore business this year than it did in 2006, Citi now forecasts.\nRio itself is now warning that Chinese demand is uncertain and global cuts to production of many commodities won't be enough to lift prices sharply.\n\"With the continuing uncertain market outlook, the board believes that maintaining the current progressive dividend policy would constrain the business and act against shareholders' long-term interests,\" Rio Tinto Chairman Jan du Plessis said.\nRio Tinto said it would now take into account more fully its profit performance, the outlook for major commodities, and the health of its balance sheet when setting future dividends. In the current financial year, the mining company aims to pay a full-year dividend of at least US$1.10 a share, which would be equivalent to a US$2 billion payout.\n\"Future dividend outcomes will really rely on the market conditions,\" said Chief Executive Sam Walsh. \"We don't run our business on hope,\" he said.\nRio Tinto has pursued a risky but calculated strategy to keep expanding the vast Australian iron-ore operations it relies on for most of its earnings, even as prices of the steelmaking commodity began a long slide to their lowest level in a decade. By doubling down on iron ore, Mr. Walsh bet that Rio's economies of scale in Australia's remote Pilbara region--which accounts for three in every five tons of iron ore traded by sea--meant it could still make a healthy profit, while other companies with higher costs were forced to shutter mines.\nOther major global miners such as BHP Billiton and Brazil's Vale, which along with Rio account for around two-thirds of iron ore output, have also increased production.\nTheir strategy has parallels with that pursued by major global oil producers, which have also kept supply high even as crude prices have slumped. The aim both of iron ore and major oil companies has been to maintain or even increase their market share even as prices fall, in the belief rival producers with higher costs would fall by the wayside.\nRio has worked to counter weaker commodity prices by strictly controlling spending, including a global freeze on wages implemented last month. It said cost savings totaled US$1.3 billion in 2015, well above an August projection of US$1 billion.\nMr. Walsh, who described recent cost-cutting efforts as \"a miracle,\" said the miner aimed to cut another US$2 billion over the next two years--a goal he said was ambitious, but achievable.\nRio Tinto follows major rivals in acting on its dividend to protect profits.\nSwiss mining and trading giant Glencore in September scrapped its dividend and raised US$2.5 billion in a share issue as part of a plan to rein in net debt. Then, in December, Anglo American said it would suspend dividend payouts as it outlined plans for a sweeping restructuring that would include cutting 85,000 jobs--more than half its workforce--and selling mines.\nVale SA more recently said it may too cut its payout, and many analysts project BHP Billiton Ltd. could slash its dividend by as much as half when it reports half-year earnings on Feb. 23.\nStill, Rio Tinto's about-turn on its dividend policy is a surprise. Mr. Walsh, who stepped up as chief executive three years ago in the aftermath of massive write-downs against Rio Tinto's operations, in 2014 said the miner's so-called progressive dividend was a key commitment that he aimed to maintain.\nOn Thursday, he defended the scrapping of that policy as a \"prudent\" move.\n\"I don't think anybody predicted what is happening in the world economy today,\" he said.\nIn the run-up to Thursday's result, most brokers had argued that Rio Tinnto had sufficient cash--underpinned by asset sales, which last month included an Australian thermal-coal deposit--and plenty of levers left to pull on spending, that it wouldn't need to pare this year's payout.\nRatings agency analysts were more cautious. Standard & Poor's Ratings Services this month placed the miner's credit ratings on their watch list, saying executives needed to step up measures to preserve cash even further.\nWeak prices have certainly taken their toll.\nEarnings from Rio Tinto's iron-ore division fell 45%--even as shipments jumped 11% on-year. Copper and coal earnings dropped 27%.\nPrices for iron ore slumped last year by 40% while copper fell 25%. Expectations that China would consume vast new production of copper, iron ore and other commodities have ebbed as its economic growth slowed to its weakest in a quarter century.\nWrite to Rhiannon Hoyle at rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com\nMore from MarketWatch\n",

The new structure would have no impact on anti-infective products already on the market, such as Merrem, Zinforo, Fluenz/Flumist and Synagis, and it would not affect Avycaz, a new antibiotic, co-developed with Actavis (NYSE:ACT).\nAstraZeneca, which last year rebuffed a takeover approach by US pharma giant Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), has been looking to focus on its three priority areas which include oncology, respiratory and inflammation, as well as cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.\nReuters notes that antibiotics have fallen out of favour in the past decade among many big pharmaceutical companies, due to their lower margins, with the industry instead focusing on more profitable areas such as oncology. More recently, however, some companies have started looking again at the field on account of rising demand for innovative therapies to fight drug-resistant superbugs.\nAs of February 20, the consensus forecast amongst 37 polled investment analysts covering AstraZeneca for the Financial Times has it that investors should hold their position in the company.

REUTERS/Stefan Wermuth\nBy Sarah Young | LONDON\nLONDON SABMiller SAB.L is buying Britain's Meantime Brewing Company, swallowing up one of the pioneers of the country's craft brewing movement to give the owner of big brands such as Peroni and Grolsch exposure to a fast-growing part of the drinks market.\nA surge in demand for craft beers in recent years has stolen market share from the world's two biggest brewers, SABMiller and Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR), as drinkers seek new tastes and support niche, local suppliers.\nSales volumes of Meantime's beers including London Pale Ale and London Lager soared 58 percent in 2014, compared with a 1 percent rise in Britain's beer market as a whole. The more richly flavored craft beer also sells at a premium to standard lager, another draw for SABMiller.\nHowever, some supporters of craft beer say brands such as Meantime, which was founded in 1999 with the backing of a group of friends in a former tramshed in Greenwich, south London, risk losing their appeal if they sell out to a global brewer.\n\"I probably won't be drinking Meantime anymore,\" said Jeff Rosenmeier, founder of the Lovibonds craft brewery in Henley-on-Thames, southern England, though he conceded most drinkers  wouldn't notice and only \"beer geeks\" would turn away from it.\n\"Lame, lame, lame,\" wrote one craft beer fan on Twitter, while another said \"Goodbye to a indie brewery success story\".\nMeantime chief executive Nick Miller, who joined from SABMiller in 2011, rejected the criticism.\n\"Why would Meantime suddenly not become a craft beer just because it's got a different set of shareholders?\" he asked on a call with reporters.\n\"Are you telling me that shareholders determine whether you're craft or not? Surely it's about the liquid, the beers that you produce, and the passion that you have for producing beer?\"\nMeantime's founder Alastair Hook, its brew master, and Miller will continue to be part of Meantime following completion of the deal, expected in early June.\nSABMiller said it aimed to grow sales of Meantime's beers across Britain and use its distribution networks to export it to other markets in Europe.\nAB InBev bought Goose Island, a U.S. craft beer brand, in 2011, and in the past year acquired craft names Blue Point and 10 Barrels, prompting a backlash on social media, with the three brands featuring on the website \"Craftbeerblacklist\".\nSABMiller's U.S. joint venture with Molson Coors, MillerCoors, already sells Blue Moon in that country, another beer that plays in the craft beer category, although it has also faced some criticism.\nDespite that, analysts welcomed SABMiller's expansion into a fast-growing market.\n\"The variety of styles added to SAB's extensive local and heritage beer menu should serve it well,\" Accendo Market's Mike van Dulken said.\nSABMiller shares were up 1.2 percent at 3,644 pence at 1120 GMT (7.20 a.m. ET), within a UK blue-chip index up 0.3 percent .FTSE .\nThe financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but will be small in the context of SABMiller's market capitalization of 58 billion pounds ($91 billion). SABMiller sold 245 million hectolitres of lager in 2014, compared with Meantime's annual capacity for production of 120,000 hectolitres.\n(This story was refiled to fix the spelling of Grolsch in the first paragraph)\n(Editing by Keith Weir and Mark Potter)\nNext In Deals\n",

The quantum is irrelevant.”\nThe Evening Standard understands that Sands has given up some $6 million, down from $6.65 million.\nAcross the group, total bonuses are down just 9% against the 30% fall in profits, which Sands defended, saying that “98% of our staff work outside the UK, where competition for talent is enormous”.\nRelated stories\nHSBC 'helped customers avoid millions in tax' through Swiss operations\n \nThe shares rose 5% on the results, gaining 53.3p to 1027.5p, largely on relief that they did not include a feared rights issue.\nThe dividend for the year was held at 86 cents.\nSands admitted that 2014 had been “disappointing” and said it was “one of the more challenging sets of results that I have had to present”.\nRevenues at the emerging markets bank slipped 2% to $18.2 billion and bad debt provisions up by 32% at £2.1 billion, in contrast to most Western banks, which are reducing their writedowns for bad loans.\nChairman Sir John Peace, who is also quitting the bank next year, said: “There are significant factors impacting our current performance which cannot be ignored: the imperative to build capital levels across the industry; the need for ongoing investment in enhancing our systems and processes associated with conduct and compliance; and the need to change the shape of our business to fit the demands of the current economic and regulatory landscape.”\nThe bank outlined plans to cut its cost base by a further $1.8 billion between 2015 and 2017, partly through job cuts and branch closures.\nIt said it would target a return on equity of at least 10% in the medium term, up from last year’s 7.8%.\n",

  "articleText" : "EMAIL\nEPA\nWarren Buffett’s diversified investment firm late Friday reported 9.8% first-quarter profit growth — a boost of confidence going into the company’s weekend festivities and a much-needed bright spot for what’s been a challenging earnings season for other companies so far.\nBerkshire Hathaway reported a first-quarter profit of $5.2 billion on 7% higher revenue of $48.6 billion. All three of the company’s primary units – insurance, railroad and financial products – posted revenue gains.\nThe strength in Berkshire’s results come despite headwinds such as a strong dollar and low interest rates, says Catherine Seifert of S&P Capital IQ. “The current environment has proven to be very difficult for Berkshire’s competitors,” Seifert says. “Berkshire’s numbers look very strong.”\nBerkshire’s operating profit, which leaves out certain gains and charges, totaled $2,583 a share. That topped expectations calling for a profit of $2,374.70 a share on the same basis, says S&P Capital IQ.\nThe strong results come at a convenient time for the company as it prepares for the annual shareholders’ meeting in Omaha this weekend. Investors are eager to hear about the company’s succession plans for Buffett, 84, as well as plans for growth.\nBerkshire’s better-than-expected numbers also provides a much needed positive surprise in a first-quarter earnings season that’s been a bit hurting for good news. Currency headwinds and a tepid pace of recovery continues to dog many companies. “It’s been a below average earnings season,” says John Butters, analyst at earnings tracker Factset.\nJust 71% of the companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 have beaten earnings expectations, falling slightly shy of the 73% that have done so over the past five years on average, says Factset. If there’s a positive, it’s that enough of the companies beating earnings expectations are doing so by a wide margin. That means the results are coming in better than expected.\nBut how much better the results are depends on who you ask due to the different ways the numbers are calculated. Factset says first-quarter results are still on pace to contract during the quarter. But S&P Capital IQ says the big beats have been enough to pull earnings growth into the positive.\nSo far, 347 companies in the S&P 500 have reported their results for the quarter, S&P Capital IQ says. S&P 500 earnings growth is currently looking like it’ll be 1.7% – but that can chance as more companies report their results.\nNonetheless, Berkshire investors will have something to party about during the weekend. Shares are up 77% over the past three years, topping the S&P 500’s 48% gain. Shares of the Class B shares of Berkshire closed Friday up $2.15, or 1.5%, to $143.36.\n",

  "articleText" : "Basic Materials | Thu Aug 6, 2015 | 11:21am EDT\nRio Tinto CEO rejects fears over China growth, demand\nBy Eric Onstad | LONDON\nLONDON Aug 6 Demand for commodities is healthy on the ground in top consumer China despite worries about an economic slowdown that has weighed on prices, the head of mining group Rio Tinto  said on Thursday.\nIt was unclear, however, when China will cut back excess output in aluminium that has led to heavy exports and a glut on world markets, Chief Executive Sam Walsh said.\nThe 19-commodity Thomson Reuters/Core Commodity CRB Index  this week hit the lowest levels in 12 years, partly due to worries about a slowdown in growth in the world's second largest economy China.\nSome foreign investors and analysts have said China is growing only half as fast as the 7 percent that official data shows, or maybe even slower.\n\"If I step back from it and look at demand for our products, almost without exception, the demand is strong from China,\" Walsh told reporters after Rio released first-half results.\n\"Whether it be iron ore, copper, gold, silver or diamonds, the demand is strong and that indicates that the fundamentals are much stronger than some external pundits are saying.\"\nRio, the world's second biggest producer of iron ore, said in its results statement it expects a \"new normal\" of lower global growth from a higher base.\nResearch by economists at the Anglo-Australian mining group supports the Chinese government's target of 7 percent economic growth this year, Walsh added.\n\"They're (Rio economists) basing that on a lot of bottom up analysis and factors and also input from a number of expert companies based in China.\"\nWalsh said some future closures of Chinese aluminium smelters, which could help curb global oversupply, may be prompted by China's move to a consumer-led economy from one focused on investment in infrastructure.\nMany smelters in China near coal fields are still operating using \"stranded power\", but this will eventually change.\n\"Some of that power will be needed to drive a consumption led economy,\" he said. \"It's not impossible that there'll be a rejigging of aluminium production. Exactly when that comes to pass, it's pretty tough to tell.\"\nThe benchmark aluminium price on the London Metal Exchange hit its lowest in six years on Thursday amid strong Chinese exports of semi-finished aluminium products, which jumped 44 percent in the first half of the year.

This is a hefty premium of around 52 percent to the 90-day trading average for BG, setting the bar high for any potential rival bidders.\nThe biggest merger this year will give Shell access to BG's multi-billion-dollar operations inBrazil, East Africa, Australia, Kazakhstan and Egypt. These include some of the world's most ambitious liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects.\nAdvertisement\nStitched together by Shell CEO Ben van Beurden and BG Chairman Andrew Gould, the deal comes after oil prices halved since last June, putting a premium on access to proven assets rather than costly exploration.\n\"We have been scanning quite a few opportunities, with BG always being at the top of the list of the prospects to combine with,\" Shell's Van Beurden told a conference call.\n\"We have two very strong portfolios combining globally in deep water and integrated gas\".\nShell said the deal would boost its proven oil and gas reserves by 25 percent. The firm also plans to increase asset sales to $30 billion between 2016-2018 on the back of the deal.\nBritain's BG had a market capitalization of $46 billion as of Tuesday close, Shell was worth $202 billion while Exxon, the world's largest oil company by market value, was worth $360 billion.\nBG shares leapt 37 percent for 1,250 pence, while Shell's were down 2.2 percent at 2048 pence by 0905 GMT. BG shares have tumbled nearly 28 percent since mid-June, when the slump in global oil prices started.\n \nCOMPETITION ISSUES\nVan Beurden said the presence of two large firms in Australia,  Brazil  and China and the European Union might require a detailed conversation with anti-trust authorities but was unlikely to lead to forced asset sales.\nThe halving in crude prices on the back of a shale oil boom in the United States and a decision by Saudi Arabia not to cut production has created an environment similar to the turn of the century when many large mergers took place.\nBack then, oil major BP ( BP.L ) acquired rival Amoco and Arco, Exxon bought Mobil and Chevron ( CVX.N ) merged with Texaco.\nShell has long been seen as a potential purchaser thanks to its healthy cash flow and relatively low oil price breakeven.\nThe company was able to maintain capital and operating expenses and pay dividend at a price of oil of around $75 per barrel without borrowing too much money. However, BG's breakeven is as high as $145 per barrel, according to analyst estimates.\nLast year, BG Chairman Gould hired CEO Helge Lund from Norway's Statoil ( STL.OL ) to turn around the company. Gould said on Wednesday Lund would remain the CEO through transition.\nHowever, it became evident on Wednesday the deal was done by two people -- Van Beurden, who took over as the CEO last year - and Gould, a veteran executive who previously run oil services giant Schlumberger ( SLB.N ).\n\"I called Andrew up and we had a very good and constructive discussion about the idea and it very quickly seemed to make sense to both of us,\" Van Beurden told a conference call.\n\"What has happened in last month, apart from it being a logical deal it has also become a very compelling deal from a value perspective,\" he added.\nThe deal, which should generate pretax synergies of around 2.5 billion pounds per year, will result in BG shareholders owning around 19 percent of the combined group.\n\"We fully understand the strategic drivers of the transaction, and believe the fit an excellent one for Shell,\" analysts from Jefferies said.\n\"The imperative now becomes for management to convince the market of the financial implications: near term earnings dilution; a significantly more levered balance sheet; and a higher priority for debt reduction versus dividends on cash utilization,\" they added.\nShell is being advised by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, while BG's advisers are Goldman Sachs and Robey Warshaw.\nAdvertisement\n",

However, much of Peroni's success has been in West European markets where SABMiller did not have operations on the ground, so the brand shouldn't suffer as a result.\"\nBy selling the brands, AB Inbev had wanted to \"proactively address\" any potential regulatory issues in its takeover of SABMiller, the largest takeover of a UK-based firm, as well as the fourth biggest in corporate history.\nThe Budweiser brewer has also sold SABMiller's 58% stake in US joint venture MillerCoors to its main partner in the business, Molson Coors, for $12bn.\nThe company created from the £70bn merger between AB Inbev and SAB will produce about 30% of the world's beer.

Entertainment One’s business model helps to finance content and in return, retains the distribution rights, a similar model to subscription platforms such as Netflix and Amazon video.\n“One possible option ITV may pursue – if it did buy EOne – would be to divest of the films business, which is more volatile and which would seem to fit in less with its content strategy,” theorised Liberum.\nShares in Entertainment One shot up 18% on the news, but appear to be levelling after the statement.\nShare\n",

REUTERS/Thomas Peter\nBy Philip Blenkinsop and Foo Yun Chee | BRUSSELS\nBRUSSELS EU antitrust regulators have dropped Shell, BP, and Statoil from an investigation into suspected rigging of ethanol benchmarks, focusing instead on three producers of the biofuel.\nThe European Commission said on Monday it had opened a formal antitrust investigation into the actions of Spanish company Abengoa SA, Belgium's Alcogroup SA and Lantmännen ek för of Sweden.\nIn April, EU antitrust regulators raided several bioenthanol companies and at the same time stepped up a two-year investigation into biofuel price benchmarks. In 2013, it searched the offices of BP, Shell and Statoil too.\nBP, Shell, Statoil and price reporting agency Platts have been told they are not part of the investigation opened on Monday, two sources familiar with the matter said.\n\"The Commission's investigation focuses on behaviors in price benchmarks for the ethanol sector,\" the EU competition authority said in response to an email asking if crude oil and refined products were still being assessed.\n\"The Commission is currently not investigating further behaviors in price benchmarks for the crude oil sector.\"\nBP was not immediately available for comment, Shell declined to comment, and a spokeswoman for Norwegian state producer Statoil said there were no formal charges or accusations against the company.\nThe Commission said it was concerned that Abengoa, Alcogroup  and Lantmännen ek för may have colluded to manipulate ethanol benchmarks published by Platts.\nIt said this could include agreeing to submit or support bids to hike the benchmark and so drive up ethanol prices, leading to less use of biofuels as an alternative to fossil fuels, with negative consequences for consumers and the environment.\nPlatts said it had not been charged with any wrongdoing and was not an addressee of the European Commission's statement of objections in relation to the bioethanol pricing investigation.\nAlcogroup said: \"Alcodis and Alcogroup operate their activities in accordance with European law and therefore fully cooperate with the European Commission whilst ensuring their fundamental rights to be respected.\"\nLantmännen said it \"cooperates fully with the authority\". Abengoa was not immediately available for comment.\nIn a separate case, the Commission is also investigating several bioethanol producers on suspicion of taking part in a cartel following searches of offices. The sources said the oil majors are not involved in this case either.\nEthanol is made from biomass such as wheat, maize or sugar beet that is mainly added to gasoline and used as a biofuel for certain motor vehicles.\n(Reporting by Philip Blenkinsop; Addtional reporting by Dmitry Zhdannikov in London and Gwladys Fouche in Oslo; Editing by Susan Thomas)\nNext In Commodities\nIran optimistic on OPEC deal after meeting Algerian minister\nDUBAI Iran is optimistic OPEC can reach a deal on limiting oil supplies and plans to announce its own decision about any output curbs at the group's meeting next week, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on the ministry's official website SHANA.\nSaudi wants OPEC to solve own problems before meeting non-OPEC\nDUBAI/LONDON Top OPEC oil exporter Saudi Arabia has told the producer group it will not attend talks on Monday with non-OPEC producers to discuss limiting supply, OPEC sources said, as it wants to focus on having consensus within the organization first.\nShell CEO expects no valuation hit from climate accord\nAMSTERDAM Royal Dutch Shell expects to pump out all the fossil fuel reserves listed on its balance sheet, its chief executive said, dismissing concerns that production limits in the wake of the Paris climate accord could hit the energy giant's valuation.\nMORE FROM REUTERS\nFrom Around the Web Promoted by Taboola\nTrending Stories\n",

The number is still being worked out, it cited one person as saying.\nHeidi Ashley, a spokeswoman for HSBC in London, declined to comment on the report. The company employed almost 258,000 people at the end of last year.\nGulliver, 56, is striving to reduce costs and sell businesses to bolster earnings, while spending billions of dollars to boost internal compliance. The job-cutting target will exclude the potential impact of selling businesses in Brazil and Turkey, as well as the possible separation of HSBC’s U.K. arm to meet a requirement to separate the consumer and investment banking businesses, Sky said.\nThe bank also is threatening to leave the U.K. over tax increases and the introduction of some of the toughest regulations in the world. Last year the British levy imposed on the firm’s global balance sheets cost HSBC 750 million pounds ($1.1 billion), the most among U.K. lenders.\nIt’s vital HSBC set a clear target for reducing expenses so that it can improve returns to shareholders, who’ve seen insufficient evidence of progress, James Chappell, an analyst at Berenberg Bank, wrote in a note to clients last month.

  "articleText" : "Banks and Finance\nRBS bosses ordered to go out and meet small firms\nExecutives lost touch with reality before the financial crash, and the bank’s    commercial banking chief says meeting SMEs is the best way to stay focused\nAlison Rose was promoted to head the commercial and private banking business at RBS 16 months ago \nFollow\nSenior managers at Royal Bank of Scotland have been ordered to meet more small firms to make sure they stay focused on customer service and do not repeat the mistakes of the pre-crash years, when they “forgot what they were there for,” in a new rule from the bank’s commercial and private banking chief.\nAlison Rose heads the division, and wants the top brass to follow her example of meeting two or three small businesses per week to understand what customers need from RBS.\n“I make all of my executive committee and myself own customer relationships, because it is important to stay connected with businesses,” she said, adding that this includes working through the SME’s books and making decisions on loan applications.\n“I think if you’re an executive and you’re not spending time with customers, you become completely disconnected from what the business is all about. The whole point is, banks forgot what they were there for – if you only ever see things through the filter of a large corporate, you don’t get a real feel, whereas if you go and sit down with a customer, they are not shy about saying, “I don’t like this” or “there is a problem here.””\nRBS is Britain’s biggest lender to businesses, but its reputation has taken a series of knocks in recent years, with customers claiming compensation for interest rate swap mis-selling , and investigations into the bank’s Global Restructuring Group which was accused of profiting from small firms’ financial problems.\n“I think we’ve got a long way to go in improving customer service and the trust and the advocacy,” she said.\nAlison Rose said RBS' bosses have to step out of their office in London and meet small businesses more often  Photo: AP\nMs Rose said she is sending all 3,500 relationship managers at the bank on a new set of training courses working on the basics of banking from credit risk through to culture and behaviour, as well as making more staff specialise in specific sectors.\nShe is also taking the course, along with the executive committee.\nAnother part of that is to show customers that she is not a distant figure at head office turning down loans on a whim.\n“I’m quite ordinary, and I think that is quite important, that they don’t think there is a big bad boss up at central office opining on their business,” said Ms Rose.\nShe was speaking after the government began selling down the shares acquired in the bank bailouts of 2008 and 2009.\nChancellor George Osborne said the sale of a 5.4pc stake in the bank for £2.1bn indicates it is now “time for RBS to rebuild itself as a commercial bank, no longer reliant on the state, but serving the working people of Britain.”\nThe first stage of the privatisation came after the bank reported profits of £293m in the second quarter of 2015, as RBS continues to struggle with the costs of compensating customers for past mis-selling.\nFollow the Telegraph on LinkedIn.

  "articleText" : "Published: Apr 29, 2016 5:03 a.m. ET\nShare\nBy\nSaabiraChaudhuri\nLONDON-- Anheuser-Busch InBev NV has offered to sell SABMiller PLC's Central and Eastern European brands, including Pilsner Urquell, ahead of a decision by the European Commission on whether to approve its acquisition of the London-based brewer.\nThe assets could fetch around $5 billion, according to Exane BNP Paribas analysts, who estimate they made up about $2.3 billion in sales and $450 million in earnings before interest and taxes for SABMiller.\nAB InBev is offering up all of SABMiller's assets in Hungary, Romania, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland, which includes the rights to Pilsner Urquell outside the U.S. Within the U.S. AB InBev has already agreed to sell Pilsner Urquell to Molson Coors as part of a larger deal divesting its stake in the American brewer's joint venture with SABMiller.\nThe potential sale announced Friday would also include brands such as Polish beers Tyskie and Lech, Hungarian beer Dreher, and Romanian beer brand Ursus. Eastern Europe has historically not been a major focus for AB InBev and the deal is aimed at mitigating concerns the European Commission could have about the pending merger.\nSABMiller is currently the third-largest brewer in Eastern Europe, with a market share of roughly 15%, according to Euromonitor, while AB InBev trails behind with a share of 7.9%.\nCarlsberg A/S and Heineken NV, the Nos. 1 and 2 brewers in Eastern Europe by market share, could potentially snap up some of the assets, although Exane warned that Heineken would likely run into regulatory hurdles. Molson Coors and Turkey's Anadolu Group also have large chunks of the market there.\nAt AB InBev's shareholder meeting this week, Chief Executive Carlos Brito said management was currently focused on two things: interacting with regulators and integration planning.\n\"Since day one, we said we'd be very proactive and up front with regulators to avoid any overlaps,\" he said. \"Of course, the final word is from the regulators.\"\nIn addition to agreeing to sell SABMiller's share of its joint venture in the U.S., AB InBev has taken a series of other steps to ensure its acquisition of SABMiller is waved through.\nEarlier this month, the Belgian-based brewer accepted an offer from Asahi Group Holdings Ltd. for its European premium brands Peroni and Grolsch, as well as British craft beer brand Meantime. Exane analysts said Asahi could be another potential buyer of some of the assets being offered up on Friday.\nAB InBev also recently reached an agreement with the South African government to create a $69 million investment fund and other commitments designed to help it secure regulatory approval for the deal there. South Africa's Competition Commission recently asked for an extension of its review because it had concerns about the merger.\nThe European Commission, which is studying AB InBev's pending deal to buy SABMiller, will make a decision on May 24. It could either wave the acquisition forward or lay out objections, pushing the deal into a so-called phase-two review, which can often be a long and difficult process. AB InBev has been aiming to clear the deal in the first phase of the commission's review.\nThe AB InBev-SABMiller merger would create the world's biggest beer group with about 30% of the global beer market.\nNatalia Drozdiak and Razak Musah Baba\ncontributed to this article.\nWrite to Saabira Chaudhuri at saabira.chaudhuri@wsj.com\nMore from MarketWatch\n",

The timing of the approach, after more than a decade of acquisitions by AB InBev, follows a roughly 15 percent drop in SABMiller's share price since August.\n\"It's exactly the moment they've been waiting for,\" said Morningstar analyst Phil Gorham. \"It makes sense financially for the first time in years.\"\nAB InBev will have to pay at least 40 pounds ($62) per SAB Miller share, and maybe as much as 45 pounds, according to analysts - implying an overall price of up to $130 billion, including SABMiller's debt.\nThat would make it the biggest M&A deal of 2015, already shaping up to be a record year since the 2008 financial crisis in terms of deal volume, and one the five largest takeovers since 1980.\nShares in SAB closed up 19.9 percent at 36.14 pounds, giving it a market capitalization of $90 billion. AB InBev's were up 6.4 percent. Rivals Heineken, Carlsberg and Diageo also rose on speculation SAB might seek another merger as a defence strategy, as it did last year when it offered to buy Heineken, but was rebuffed.\nSince then it has combined its African soft drink bottler with that of Coca-Cola, and in recent weeks there has been speculation about it combining with Diageo or Australian drinks firm Coca-Cola Amatil.\nThe global beer market share of AB InBev, maker of Budweiser, Stella Artois and Corona, was 21.1 percent in 2014, while SABMiller's was 15 percent, according to industry experts Plato Logic. Heineken is the No. 3.\nROOM FOR FUNDING\nAB InBev's target for its net debt to core profit (EBITDA) ratio is 2 times, from around 2.5 currently. It is likely to reach that by 2016, the earliest any deal could realistically be completed, and so has room to borrow to fund any takeover.\nWhen it bought Budweiser-maker Anheuser-Busch in 2008 for $52 billion, the largest cash takeover in history at the time, it let the ratio rise to beyond 5 times. Going that high again might allow it to raise as much as $100 billion in debt.\nAB InBev's controlling families own just over half of the company, while SABMiller's two top shareholders are cigarette maker Altria and the Santo Domingo family of Colombia.\nAltria on Wednesday declined comment on the AB InBev approach, but on Sept. 9, its CFO Billy Gifford said at an analyst conference that it regularly evaluates its SABMiller investment \"and at this time we believe maintaining the asset is in our shareholders' best interests.\"\nThe Santo Domingo family could not immediately be reached for comment.\nNeil Dwane, European chief investment officer, equity, at Allianz Global Investors, which holds shares in both companies, said AB InBev had faced increasing pressure to return excess cash to shareholders.\n\"ABI is paying a high price but accretion to earnings from low debt costs would be something in the region of 15 percent. However, we think the return on this deal could be a relatively disappointing 8 percent after 10 years,\" Dwane said.\nThere are significant antitrust hurdles to any combination, particularly in the United States, where the companies would have about 70 percent of the beer market.\n\"The costs that could be saved in the distribution operations are high - and the antitrust hurdles are higher,\" said Erik Gordon, professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business.\nA deal would allow Molson Coors to acquire the 58 percent of the joint venture owned by SABMiller according to the operating agreement that governs it. A change in control at SABMiller would automatically give Molson the right to acquire an additional 8 percent and name a new CEO at the venture. Denver-based Molson would also have the right of first and last offer for the remaining 50 percent stake.\nA Molson spokesman declined to comment on whether the company would be interested in a bid, but Molson shares surged more than 12 percent to an all-time high.\nAny merged group may also have to sell interests in China, where SABMiller's CR Snow joint venture with China Resources  is the market leader. Heineken, Carlsberg or China's Tsingtao could be potential buyers.\nPlato estimates that after disposals, the combined group could end up with a 28 percent global market share.\nAB InBev is being advised by Lazard, while SABMiller is being advised by Robey Warshaw, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley.\n($1 = 0.6486 pounds)\n(Additional reporting by Kate Holton, Alasdair Pal, Freya Berry, Sinead Cruise, Anjali Athavaley, Jilian Mincer and Emiliano Mellino; Writing by Christian Plumb; Editing by Pravin Char, Elaine Hardcastle and Alan Crosby)\nNext In Hot Stocks\n",

  "articleText" : "Add Your Note (Optional):\n \nLONDON (Alliance News) - Glencore PLC Wednesday said it has revised down its capital expenditure budget for 2015 in response to \"the volatile market backdrop\" and said production rose across the board during 2014, as it announced it will divest its stake in Lonmin PLC in the first half of 2015.\nIn December, the mining and oil company had laid out a USD7.9 billion capital expenditure budget for 2015, which has now been revised down to between USD6.5 billion and USD6.8 billion.\nGlencore said it will divest from its 23.9% stake in platinum miner Lonmin during the first half of 2015 by distributing Lonmin shares to Glencore shareholders. Glencore acquired the stake in Lonmin through its acquisition of Xstrata PLC in May 2013, and said it has always classed the stake as \"non-core\" because the company does not trade in platinum or have any \"special insight\" into the market.\n\"It is currently proposed that the divestment in Lonmin will be implemented by way of a distribution in specie to Glencore shareholders. This distribution, currently representing 3 cents per Glencore share, will not impact Glencore's approach towards its annual cash distribution consideration,\" said the company.\nLonmin responded with its own statement, saying: \"Glencore's proposal is a constructive way forward which would enable Glencore shareholders to continue their participation in Lonmin's future.\"\nGlencore experienced a rise in production across all of its commodities in 2014, apart from zinc which remained flat from 2013. The increase was mainly attributable to the acquisition of Xstra and Caracal.\nGlencore's own-sourced copper production for 2014 totalled 1.5 million tonnes, up 4% from 2013 and mainly driven by a ramp-up at the Mutanda mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The production increase was offset by average copper prices falling 6% to USD6,866 per tonne from USD7,328 a year earlier.\nOwn-sourced nickel production was up 3% year on year to 101,000 tonnes after increased production at the Koniambo mine and increased grades at the Raglan mine in Canada. Average nickel prices rose by 13% from 2013 to USD16,892 per tonne from USD15,012.\nOwn-sourced ferrochrome production rose by 5% from 2013 to 1.3 million tonnes, reflecting the ramp-up at the Lion phase 2 project in South Africa, which is expected to reach full capacity by the middle of 2015, Glencore said.\nOwn-sourced coal production totalled 146.3 million tonnes, up 6% from 2013 after a series of productivity improvements across its coal portfolio in Australia. Glencore said it shutdown its Australian coal operation in December 2014 and January 2015 \"in response to the subdued market environment\".\nOwn-sourced zinc production was the only commodity not to experience an increase during 2014, remaining flat from a year earlier at 1.4 million tonnes. However, nickel production was up 12% quarter on quarter. Average zinc prices increased by 13% year on year to USD2,164 per tonne in 2014 from USD1,909.\nGlencore's oil entitlement rose year on year by 47% to 7.4 million barrels in 2014, caused by the Alen and Badila assets recording their first full-year of production and the company increasing its stake in its assets in Chad following the Caracal acquisition.\nThe company said the Managara field in Chad, which began producing in December, will see a steady ramp-up in 2015.\nGlencore shares were up 0.3% to 271.90 pence per share on Wednesday morning.\nBy Joshua Warner; joshuawarner@alliancenews.com; @JoshAlliance\nCopyright 2015 Alliance News Limited.

  "articleText" : "Is HSBC’s Loss Feeding a Fear in Banking?\nQuarterly loss of $858 million first since at least 2009\nProfit from Asia region fell 14 percent amid China volatility\nShare on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp\nEight months after HSBC Holdings Plc unveiled a $100 billion bet on Asia, crashing commodity prices and a slowing Chinese economy are checking Stuart Gulliver’s ambitions.\nThe chief executive officer oversaw his first pretax loss as profit from Asia fell 14 percent to $2.82 billion in the fourth quarter and loans in that region dropped to the lowest in almost two years. The bank also\ndisclosed that its hiring practices in Asia Pacific, like those of other lenders, are being probed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe results mark a setback to Gulliver’s efforts to bolster profitability and reverse a share slump by betting on the Chinese economy. Slower growth in the world’s second-largest economy may hamper the strategy, unveiled in June, to redeploy $100 billion of risk-weighted assets in Asia, and the bank said on Monday it will add staff for a China venture at a slower pace.\n“We will redeploy a little slower, we will hire a little bit slower,” Gulliver, 56, said on a call with journalists Monday. “We’re certainly not going to compromise our credit standards” for more loan growth, he said, adding that the change in pace doesn’t mean the bank will alter its strategy.\nHigher Impairments\nEurope’s largest bank reported an unexpected pretax loss of $858 million, driven by a drop in revenue and an increase in impairment charges that was fueled by loans to oil and gas companies. The bank made a 7.2 percent return on equity, falling short of its target of more than 10 percent.\nStuart Gulliver\nPhotographer: Justin Chin/Bloomberg\nRevenue in the Asia region dropped 5.7 percent to $5.46 billion, while loans fell to $356.4 billion, the lowest since the first quarter of 2014. Loan impairment costs jumped 26 percent in the region.\nGulliver said Monday that hiring of 4,000 employees for a major development in China’s Pearl River Delta will take place over five years instead of three years as a result of economic and government turmoil.\n“China’s slower economic growth will undoubtedly contribute to a bumpier financial environment,” Chairman Douglas Flint said in the bank’s full-year results statement.\nU.S. authorities are examining whether the bank hired relatives of well-connected politicians or employees of state-owned businesses in the Asia-Pacific region, HSBC disclosed Monday. Other banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. have said previously that they are facing similar investigations.\nHSBC dropped 1 percent at 4:13 p.m. in London, after earlier falling as much as 5.4 percent.\nCost Cuts\nSince taking over in 2011 Gulliver has announced more than 87,000 job cuts, exited about 83 businesses and has reduced the bank’s sprawling global footprint to 71 countries and territories from 88. \nWhile HSBC targets positive “jaws,” the difference between the rate of revenue and cost growth, the measure was negative 3.7 percent for the year. Revenue in the fourth quarter tumbled 18 percent to $11.8 billion as net interest income fell to $8.1 billion. Operating costs in the period amounted to $11.5 billion, down from $11.9 billion a year earlier.\nHSBC has started to feel the effects of declining credit quality as experienced by fellow emerging-markets focused lender Standard Chartered Plc, which reports its full year results Tuesday. Impairments on bad loans and credit-risk provisions increased by 32 percent to $1.64 billion in the quarter. That took full-year charges to $3.7 billion, exceeding the consensus analyst estimate of $3 billion.\nThe increase in bad-loan charges in HSBC’s wholesale banking division, which accounted for almost $1 billion of loan impairment charges in the quarter, was driven by the oil and gas sector, the company said. HSBC has a “pretty strong” lending book in that industry, as about half of the firm’s exposure is to state-owned companies, Gulliver said on a conference call with analysts.\nHSBC shares in Hong Kong have traded at a premium to analysts’ consensus target price just twice this decade.\nHSBC reduced risk-weighted assets by $124 billion last year, taking it almost half-way toward the target for the end of 2017. The company’s end-point common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of financial strength monitored by regulators, rose to 11.9 percent from 11.1 percent a year earlier.\nThe bank will “only” deploy capital in businesses that hit its return targets, Finance Director Iain Mackay said on a call with analysts. Management remained “very, very focused” on cutting as much as $5 billion in costs, which is a “significant undertaking,” he said.\nRaised Dividend\nThe bank declared a dividend of 21 cents for the fourth quarter, taking the total for the year to 51 cents. That’s 1 cent more than last year, maintaining the bank’s progressive dividend policy valued by investors.\n“Management is on the right track,” Martin Gilbert, CEO of Aberdeen Asset Management Plc, the bank’s sixth-largest shareholder, said in an e-mail.\nHSBC cut the annual bonus pool about $100 million to $3.5 billion, as overall employee compensation fell to $19.9 billion from $20.4 billion, according to the annual report. CEO Gulliver had his variable pay for 2015 cut 361,000 pounds ($513,000) to 3 million pounds, reducing his total compensation to the lowest since taking the CEO role in 2011.\nWhile the bank slowed some of its plans in Asia, executives still see reasons for optimism in the region. Even with the fourth-quarter decline, the region accounted for 84 percent of the company’s profit in 2015, up from 78 percent in 2014.\n“If you think about China, we continue to see growth rates north of 6.5 percent,” Mackay said. “We continue to see a pretty supportive environment for some aspects of growth within the vast majority of our Asian markets.”\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

REUTERS/Jan Van De Vel\nBy Diane Bartz | WASHINGTON\nWASHINGTON Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR), the world's biggest brewer, faced tough questions on Tuesday from U.S. lawmakers unhappy over its plan to buy SABMiller SAB.L due to concerns the deal will hurt the fast-growing U.S. craft beer industry.\nAB InBev announced the $106 billion deal in November, promising to sell SABMiller's stake in MillerCoors to Molson Coors so it could win U.S. antitrust approval. The company has said it did the deal to expand in Africa, Asia and Latin America.\nBut in a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee, lawmakers worried about the merger's effect on craft beer, defined as brewing in volume of fewer than 6 million barrels annually. Craft was 11 percent of the U.S. market last year.\nDespite the panel's concerns, it will have no say on whether it goes ahead. That decision lies with the U.S. Justice Department.\nThe AB InBev deal for SABMiller is the latest in a long list of beer deals that range from InBev's purchase of Anheuser-Busch in 2008 to the purchases of craft beers and distributors who deliver beer for both the giants and the new craft entrants.\n\"What we've seen over the past years is a trend toward mammoth beer behemoths in our market and the result has not been a happy one for many consumers,\" said Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat. \"I would urge the Department of Justice to think beyond the divestiture that has been proposed.\"\nHe pressured AB InBev chief executive officer Carlos Brito to pledge that he would not terminate wholesalers or squeeze small craft brewers.\n\"I can commit as a result of this transaction there will be no such a thing,\" Brito responded. \"This transaction is really about the rest of the world. It's not about the U.S.\"\nLawmakers were clearly sympathetic to craft brewers. \"Nobody wants to take a seat at a bar and discover that their only choices are a Bud and a Miller,\" said Senator Chris Coons.\nCraft beer makers have two big concerns. One is that they use the same network of distributors as AB InBev and MillerCoors. AB InBev has purchased distributors, forcing the craft beers they sold to go elsewhere, said Bob Pease, head of craft industry trade group Brewers Association.\nCraft brewers also worry about losing access to ingredients and containers they need to make their beer, said Senator Patrick Leahy.\n(Reporting by Diane Bartz; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)\nNext In Deals\n",

  "articleText" : "StumbleUpon\nLONDON/BRUSSELS — Anheuser-Busch InBev raised its US$100 billion-plus bid for rival brewer SABMiller on Tuesday after a slide in the value of the pound following the Brexit vote made the offer less attractive for many investors, threatening to derail the deal.\nSABMiller said its chairman talked with his counterpart at AB InBev on Friday about the offer in the light of exchange rate volatility and market movements, although they did not discuss the new terms.\nThe world’s largest brewer will now offer 45 pounds a share for its nearest rival, an increase from the 44 pounds announced in October last year.\nIt also tweaked the terms of an alternative share-and-cash structure designed for SABMiller’s two largest shareholders, raising the cash element by 88 pence a share.\nRelated\nCanada will be smaller share of Molson Coors after US$12-billion deal for Miller brands\nThe offer values SABMiller at around 79 billion pounds (US$103.6 billion). In November, when the original bid was officially launched, it was worth around 70 billion pounds, or US$106 billion based on exchange rates at the time. That original bid had since dropped to about US$100 billion.\nAberdeen Asset Management, with a 1.17 per cent SABMiller stake according to Thomson Reuters data, said the revised offer was still unacceptable, although analysts suggested the deal was now likely to go through.\nSABMiller, which provisionally agreed the deal struck in October, said it had taken on Centerview Partners as a new financial adviser and would consult with Centerview and with shareholders before formally considering the revised offer.\nThe takeover is still awaiting regulatory approval in China. SABMiller shareholders would expect to vote on it after that.\nAB InBev (ABI), which has hedged to cover the pounds initially required, said the revised terms were final. Under British law, this means the price is set. AB InBev could only change it by dropping the offer and waiting six months to make another.\nLiberum analyst Alicia Forry said she believed the revised bid was likely to be successful by throwing a “small bone” to activist investors and shutting the door to further increases.\n“The main thing from ABI’s perspective is they don’t want this to drag and if they engaged (activists) it would,” she said.\nBernstein Research brewing analyst Trevor Stirling said SABMiller’s shares would probably drop to 41.50 pounds if AB InBev’s takeover bid failed, adding that for AB InBev, an extra US$2 billion was only a modest deterioration of a deal that made strategic sense by adding attractive African and Latin American markets.\nAt 1035 GMT, SABMiller shares were down 0.5 per cent at 44.20 pounds. AB InBev’s were up 0.9 per cent at 115.80 euros.\nThe changes come after a number of activist investors, such as Elliott Capital Advisors and TCI Fund Management, bought stakes in SABMiller and several shareholders voiced concerns at least week’s annual general meeting that the cash deal was less attractive for many investors than before and, in any case, below the share-and-cash alternative.\nThe latter, designed exclusively for Altria and Colombia’s Santo Domingo family who together own about 41 per cent of SABMiller, had been worth less than the all-cash option last year, but with the fall of sterling and a rise of AB InBev shares, has surpassed it since.\nFor a foreign dollar-based investor, the cash offer had dropped 12 per cent since the British referendum vote to leave the European Union on June 23. Meanwhile, AB InBev shares are more than 35 percent higher than October.\nAberdeen Asset Management said the revised offer undervalued the company and continued to favor SABMiller’s two major shareholders, Altria and Bevco.\nAB InBev said the share-and-cash offer value was now 51.14 pounds, so above the 45 pounds of pure cash, but the new shares offered would have to be held for at least five years.\n“I wouldn’t like to second guess what the activists were hoping for, but the increase is quite modest,” one SABMiller shareholder told Reuters.\n© Thomson Reuters 2016\n",

  "articleText" : "TSB boss: Current account switching must be simpler\nTSB’s maiden profit of £133.7 million - an increase of 2.3% - was better than analysts had expected\nWednesday 25 February 2015 09:32 BST\nClick to follow\nThe Independent Online\nSimpler switching came into force in September 2013 but so far just 3% of all current accounts have been switched Getty Images\nThe head of TSB, the challenger bank separated from Lloyds Banking Group last summer, called for current account switching to be made even simpler yesterday.\nPaul Pester, the chief executive of TSB, said: \"We gained almost 500,000 new bank accounts during 2014 but many of those did not use the switching service. Awareness of the switching service generally has dropped from 60 per cent to a paltry 16 per cent.\n\"We have suggested specific improvements to the Competition and Markets Authority. In particular you still cannot switch an overdraft.\"\nSimpler switching came into force in September 2013 but, so far, only 3 per cent of all current accounts have been switched. The CMA has been investigating competition in the current account market since November. Mr Pester said he was \"delighted\" with TSB’s maiden results, noting it had captured 8.4 per cent of the new current account market against a target of 6 per cent.\nLloyds was ordered by Brussels to sell off 632 branches because of the state aid involved in its 2009 bailout.\nOriginally it agreed to sell the branches to Co-op Bank for £750m but the mutual, chaired by the crystal meth minister Paul Flowers, then imploded with a £1.5bn black hole. Lloyds turned instead to a flotation. It sold 38.5 per cent of TSB at 260p a share in June and a further 11.5 per cent at 280p a share in September. Lloyds has already raised £1.46bn from the sale. It has to sell off the remaining 50 per cent of TSB, which it still owns, by the end of this year.\nTSB’s maiden profit of £133.7m – an increase of 2.3 per cent – was better than analysts had expected.\n \nMr Pester said that the bank’s re-entry into the mortgage market through brokers had gone well, with applications for £300m worth of home loans. For 2014, lending dropped 6 per cent to £18.8bn but Mr Pester expects that to steady and then start growing again during the second half of this year.\nHe declined to comment on reports that TSB had approached rival challenger bank Aldermore with a view to buying it before its float plan was revived yesterday. But he said: \"We are all about growth. If we can find the right thing at the right price we would be  interested.\"\nTSB said it will reduce its costs from £750m to £720m in the present financial year. As Mr Pester explained: \"Base rates are lower and are likely to remain lower for longer than we expected.\"\nTSB shares fell 1.60p to 259.6p.\n",

  "articleText" : "Barclays CEO Staley: Brexit Is Political Crisis Now\nBank doesn’t need more capital after vote to leave EU\nDollar, euro earnings will support bank amid U.K. slowdown\nShare on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp\nBarclays Plc Chief Executive Officer Jes Staley said concern about earnings, rather than capital or liquidity, has caused the “significant” dip in the bank’s share price since the U.K. voted to leave the European Union.\nThe bank may be hurt by an economic slowdown in the U.K. that’s much more likely than it was a week ago, Staley said in a Bloomberg Television interview with Erik Schatzker on Thursday. Still, the company isn’t changing the strategy of selling down its stake in its Africa unit, and agreed-upon sales of non-core assets will go through regardless of the Brexit vote, he said.\n“We got no sense of concern about our capital nor liquidity, and properly so, but there is a concern about our earnings,” Staley said. The share price decline “is being driven by concern about the U.K. economy going forward and concern about our investment bank, if in fact there is a challenge between EU and London as a financial center.”\nBarclays shares have plunged 26 percent since last week’s vote to leave the EU. A number of analysts have downgraded the bank’s shares and cut its earnings estimates as investors remain uncertain about the fallout from Brexit. One of the financial industry’s\nmain concerns is whether it will be allowed to continue doing business across the EU from Britain, known as passporting.\nImpending Slowdown\nStaley said the bank’s systems held up during the post-vote volatility, when its trading desks processed three times as many currency orders in the early hours of Friday morning as they usually do in a day. The lender was also able to roll over its short-term financing contracts with no concerns about its liquidity, he said.\nThe CEO described convening his executive committee four times a day in the past week and was in constant contact with British and U.S. regulators. While the financial industry is strong enough to serve as a stabilizing influence on the economy, a contrast to the problems it caused in the 2008 crisis, banks can’t avoid the slowdown, he said.\nWatch: Barclays CEO Staley on Brexit, BOE, U.K. Economy (Full)\nBarclays CEO Staley on Brexit, BOE, U.K. Economy\n“There will be a lot of political uncertainty, and generally political uncertainty leads to economic uncertainty and a slowdown in investing,” Staley said. “People put off decisions from major corporations to individuals wanting to buy an apartment.”\nWhile the bank’s growth in the U.K. may stall, Staley said he expected a “pop” in earnings from units that operate in other currencies that appreciated against the pound. About 60 percent of the investment bank’s revenue comes from U.S. and 50 percent of credit-card revenue generated in Germany and U.S., he said.\nStock Slump\nDealing with the fallout from Brexit is just the latest challenge for Staley, recruited seven months ago to revamp the ailing British lender. He also has to improve returns at the investment bank, which some investors and analysts have suggested he spin off, sell down Barclays’s majority stake in its African business, separate the securities unit and the consumer bank, and dispose of more than 50 billion pounds ($66 billion) of unwanted or toxic assets from its bad bank.\n“We cannot let this referendum vote change the strategy,” Staley said. “I’m not sure we can push faster or harder than we are now,” he said, adding that the firm is on track to “reduce our headcount by tens and tens of thousands of people over the course of this year.”\nStill, the shares have slumped 49 percent since he started Dec. 1, partly driven by the surprise decision to cut the dividend in half for the next two years. Staley said the reduction in the payout gives the bank more flexibility to dispose of non-core assets, even in a post-Brexit recession.\n“We don’t sleep with our stock price at this level,” the CEO said. Barclays trades “at a significant discount to book value, and it was not helped on Friday or Monday, and we need to correct that.”\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal. LEARN MORE\n",

The meeting concluded with the Fed opening the door to a June rate hike, but some policy-makers were willing to wait until next year.\n\"They left a very balanced tone in the market. A few of them were happy to wait til 2016, which is significant, and the fact that they are still debating June was a bit of a hawkish sign,\" said Aaron Kohli, interest rate strategist at BNP Paribas in New York.\nShell's bid for energy firm BG Group, the first major merger in the sector in more than a decade, boosted European shares as energy stocks that had tumbled on the plunge in oil and gas prices since last summer rallied.\nThe STOXX energy sector index in Europe, which rose as much as 6.1 percent, closed up 2.45 percent, while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares fell 0.04 percent to 1,611.68.\nRick Meckler, president of hedge fund LibertyView Capital Management LLC in Jersey City, New Jersey said Shell's bid is a big deal for a hard-hit sector that has been the weakest part of the equity market. But U.S. energy shares lagged, with super-majors Exxon Mobil and Chevron down 1.8 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively.\n\"What people are really waiting for are earnings, which either will give support for the next level or lead to a sell-off of sorts,\" Meckler said.\nThe blended estimate for U.S. first-quarter corporate earnings growth is a negative 2.8 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data, but excluding the energy sector, the earnings growth estimate is up 5.4 percent.\nThe Dow Jones industrial average rose 29.22 points, or 0.16 percent, to 17,904.64.

The dollar remained lower against the yen, down 0.2 percent to 120.02.\nOil prices dropped as much as 6 percent after U.S. crude closed the previous session at its highest this year, as the mammoth rise in U.S. stockpiles and news of record Saudi oil production wiped away speculation of a sustained recovery.\nBrent May crude fell $3.55 to settle at $55.55 a barrel.

There is an opportunity for a good low-fares carrier.”\nHiring Plan\nEasyJet can sustain 8 percent passenger growth in the next three to five years, the CEO said, adding that it will hire about 310 pilots this year while seeking to double the proportion of women in each new intake to 12 percent. It’s also looking to add 830 cabin crew after saying last month that full-year profit would be higher than expected following a jump in summer bookings.\nMcCall said her attention is fixed on expansion in core European markets, with the focus on boosting frequencies and adding connections between existing destinations -- including more flights to Iceland -- rather than opening up entirely new routes and bases.\nThat’s especially so since a new trip to Tunisia was canceled after the terrorist rampage there in June, since when traffic on EasyJet flights to Morocco and Egypt has also slowed, McCall said, with many passengers instead choosing to travel within Europe.\nMcCall said discussions with network carriers about feeding traffic between networks, something that Ryanair has said is on its agenda, have been going on for at least four years without presenting any clearly viable opportunities.\n“What I don’t want to do is over-complicate the network,” she said. “If it’s complicated -- it involves interlining or code-sharing -- it’s less likely.

  "articleText" : "Clydesdale Bank hit with record PPI fine for 'unacceptable' staff lies\nThe £20.7m fine is for a litany of abuses in handling payment protection insurance claims\nTuesday 14 April 2015 22:44 BST\nClick to follow\nThe Independent Online\nClydesdale & Yorkshire Bank has been hit with a record £20.7m fine for a litany of abuses in handling payment protection insurance claims which went as far as misleading the Financial Ombudsman.\nThe \"serious\" failings meant nearly three-quarters of 126,600 complaints decided between May 2011 and July 2013 by the Clydesdale and its sister Yorkshire Bank may have been rejected unfairly or resulted in inadequate fines, the Financial Conduct Authority said.\nThe group is now reopening the files on 180,000 complaints dating back from August last year, which could result in bigger payouts for tens of thousands of customers. \nThe fine is the largest for PPI abuses ever handed out by the financial watchdog, and almost three times as high as the next biggest, a £7m fine handed out to the former Alliance & Leicester in October 2008.\nClydesdale, recently put up for sale by National Australia Bank, refused to search for documents relating to PPI on loans and mortgages beyond the bank’s seven-year retention period, despite some records being readily available. And when calculating redress for credit card PPI complaints, handlers ignored statements that Clydesdale held for the period before 2000.\nRead more\nStop bashing bankers? Not just yet, thanks to Clydesdale\nIn the most serious cases, a Clydesdale team altered printouts for the Ombudsman to make it look as if the bank held no relevant documents, and deleted PPI information from printouts listing products sold to the customer. Management were unaware of the practice. A Clydesdale spokesman refused to say if the staff behind the worst practices had been sacked, saying only that they had been “subject to disciplinary action”.\nGeorgina Philippou, the FCA’s acting director of enforcement and market oversight, called the bank’s behaviour “unacceptable”. “The fact that Clydesdale misled the Financial Ombudsman by providing false information about the information it held is particularly serious and this is reflected in the size of the fine.” The watchdog said the fine would have been even bigger – £29.5m – if the Clydesdale had not opted to settle early in the process.\nClydesdale’s acting chief executive Debbie Crosbie gave a grovelling apology. She said: “In 2011 we introduced changes to our policies and procedures that were designed to help us respond to PPI complaints. A number of these changes were inappropriate and have disadvantaged some of our customers.

As soon as this issue was discovered, we took immediate steps to stop it.”\nAn even bigger bill for PPI could deter potential buyers for the two banks. NAB, which has owned Glasgow-based Clydesdale since 1987 and Yorkshire since 1990, said last October that it was considering a broad range of options for the banks, including a sale through public markets.\nIt also raised provisions by £420m last year in anticipation of a higher bill. So far its provisions total £806m, of which £291m has been paid out so far.\nThe FCA’s latest figures show that a total of £18.5bn has been repaid by the industry to mis-sold PPI customers since the beginning of 2011.\n",

He is well respected and with management looking to bring back more focus on the core business, we think this will please investors,\" said Atif Latif, director of trading at Guardian Stockbrokers.\nStandard Chartered gave one of the biggest lifts to the FTSE 100, which ended 0.2 percent higher at 6,949.73 points -- a new closing high and near the intraday record high of 6,958.89 points it reached on Tuesday.\nCharles Hepworth, investment director at GAM, said the approach of Britain's general elections in May could hinder the FTSE, but he still thinks it could easily exceed 7,000 points.\n\"On a technical perspective, I am optimistic that the market can make further gains from here with the FTSE 100 trading towards an upper range of 7,500, and this level possibly being met sometime during 2015,\" he said.\nRBS AND RSA FALL\nNot all UK companies rode the wave of the rising stock market.\nReed Elsevier fell 4.8 percent, making it the worst-performing FTSE stock in percentage terms. The company reported 2014 results in line with forecasts, predicted further growth for 2015 and announced plans for a 500 million-pound ($777 million) share buyback.\nBut analysts questioned whether the performance could sustain its strong stock rally. The shares have climbed more than 100 percent since 2012. Others also noted the buyback was down from last year's 600 million-pound figure.\n\"When a stock has risen by as much as Reed, there will always be room for disappointment if the figures do not beat forecasts, and traders will be looking to sell out and cash in on the rally,\" said Central Markets trading analyst Joe Neighbour.\nInsurer RSA fell 4.7 percent. Even though RSA swung back into a profit for 2014, its results were below forecasts. So was a modest 2 pence final dividend payment.\nRoyal Bank of Scotland also slid 4.1 percent. The bank posted a 2014 loss of 3.5 billion pounds and announced plans to shrink its investment banking operations to allow the state-controlled lender to refocus on local lending in Britain.\n\"RBS is just going to get bashed and bashed and bashed. Although the figures read OK, they've still got some structural issues,\" said Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital.

  "articleText" : "Add Your Note (Optional):\n \nLONDON (Alliance News) - Royal Mail PLC on Tuesday said its group revenue was flat in the first quarter of its current financial year, with a good performance in its parcels and logistics businesses but weaker revenue from its letters business.\nThe FTSE 100 postal service operator said its group revenue for the three months to June 28 was flat. Royal Mail said revenue in its UKPIL division, which covers its UK parcels and letters delivery business, was down by 2%, as revenue in its UK parcels arm rose by 2% but revenue from its letters business fell by 4%. UK parcels volume rose by 3% in the quarter, while letters volume fell 5%.\nRevenue in its GLS pan-European logistics business was up by 8%, however, on the back of 9% volume growth.\nRoyal Mail said its outlook remains unchanged for the full year and said its performance will be weighted to the second half, with a dependence on the important Christmas trading period.\n\"In the first three months of our financial year we have seen a continuation of the overall market trends we saw last year. We have benefited from the parcel initiatives that took effect in the second half of last year and a good performance from GLS. Our trading environment remains challenging and we are stepping up the pace of change to drive efficiency, growth and innovation, while maintaining a tight focus on costs,\" said Moya Greene, Royal Mail's chief executive.\nThe trading update from the postal service operator comes after Ofcom, the UK media and communications regulator, last week outlined the scope of its review into the regulation of Royal Mail, including whether any price controls should be imposed on the company given the lessening of competition in the postal services market.\nOfcom said in June that it had widened its review of the regulation of Royal Mail in light of the decision by competitor Whistl Ltd to halt its own direct delivery services in the UK. It said at the time that it would look at whether the commercial flexibility Royal Mail was given following the last regulatory review in 2012 was still appropriate and whether any pricing controls should be imposed.\nThe publication of the scope of the review, issued on Friday, confirmed that this remains on the table as an option, with Ofcom saying it will examine whether Royal Mail's wholesale costs and retail prices are affordable and sufficient to cover the costs of the universal service and whether the company's commercial flexibility remains appropriate within the changing market, including whether wholesale or retail charge controls may be appropriate.\nThe review also will examine whether any changes to the current postal regulatory framework could be appropriate in order to maintain the universal postal services and will study how to ensure Royal Mail continues to become more efficient given the absence of any significant end-to-end competition for the letters market.\nOfcom expects to complete its work and to have any revised regulatory framework put in place in 2016.\nBy Sam Unsted; samunsted@alliancenews.com; @SamUAtAlliance\nCopyright 2015 Alliance News Limited.

  "articleText" : "Market News | Wed Nov 11, 2015 | 11:02am EST\nUPDATE 4-AB InBev launches SAB bid, to sell MillerCoors stake\n* ABI sees savings of $1.4 bln from SABMiller takeover\n* Offer worth $106 bln based on Tuesday's close\n* Access to African growth key part of deal\n* Molson Coors to buy SAB stake in MillerCoors for $12 bln   (Updates with further reaction)\nBy Philip Blenkinsop and Martinne Geller\nBRUSSELS/LONDON, Nov 11 Anheuser-Busch InBev , the world's biggest brewer, launched its $100 billion-plus offer for nearest rival SABMiller on Wednesday and agreed to sell the latter's stake in U.S. venture MillerCoors to help win regulatory approval.\nAB InBev, whose takeover of SABMiller would be one of the largest mergers in corporate history, said it expected to achieve $1.4 billion in annual savings four years after completion of the deal, projected for the second half of 2016.\nThe deal currently worth about 70 billion pounds, or $106 billion, was clinched with an agreement for Denver-based Molson Coors to take over SABMiller's 58 percent stake in their venture, MillerCoors, for $12 billion.\nThat price tag is higher than some analysts expected, given the small group of potential buyers. However, they had not anticipated it including global rights to the Miller brand, which will nearly double the amount of beer Molson sells internationally.\nAt the same time, the savings target, worth about 9 percent of SABMiller's sales, is lower than expectations, although it does come on top of the $1.05 billion that SABMiller had already pledged during the bidding process.\nThe merger will combine AB InBev's Budweiser, Stella Artois and Corona brands with SABMiller's Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell and brew almost a third of the world's beer, dwarfing rivals Heineken and Carlsberg.\nThe takeover, which SABMiller's board provisionally accepted last month, would be the largest of a British-based company and the fourth-biggest overall of any corporation. It will be backed by a record $75 billion loan.\nGLOBAL SHUFFLE\nAB InBev is already leader in the United States, Brazil and Mexico, three of the top four markets in terms of profits.\nWith SABMiller, it is buying into Latin American countries such as Colombia and Peru and crucially, Africa, at a time when markets such as the United States are weakening as drinkers shun mainstream lagers in favour of craft brews and cocktails.\nAfrica, where SAB operates in 16 countries, is expected to see a sharp rise in people of legal drinking age and has a fast-growing middle-class developing a taste for branded lagers and ales. Beer consumption there will grow by more than anywhere else over the next five years, say industry experts Plato Logic.\nThe acquisition allows AB InBev to draw level with Unilever  as the fourth-biggest consumer goods company with annual revenue of $64 billion. However it will overtake Nestle  as the sector's biggest profit generator.\nAB InBev said it would seek a secondary listing and regional headquarters in Johannesburg, where SABMiller was founded 120 years ago.\nThe transaction is also a \"game changer\" for Molson Coors, its CEO Mark Hunter said, as it gives the maker of Coors Light and Blue Moon nearly 28 percent of the U.S. market, making it the second largest player.\nIt would add nearly $5 billion a year in sales and nearly $1 billion in operating income.\nHURDLES TO CLEAR\nAB InBev is offering 44 pounds per SABMiller share, along with a discounted alternative of mostly shares, designed for SABMiller's two largest shareholders: cigarette-maker Altria  and BevCo, the vehicle of Colombia's Santo Domingo family, who together own 40.5 percent of the target company.\nThose shareholders have accepted the alternative offer, the two brewers said in a joint statement. Altria said it expected to book a post-tax gain of $8 billion when the deal closed.\nSABMiller shares were up 2.0 percent at 40.54 pounds at 1515 GMT on Wednesday, with gains limited by a degree of uncertainty around regulatory hurdles before the transaction is concluded. The shares have gained almost 40 percent since speculation about an AB InBev approach emerged two months ago.\nHowever, AB InBev's confidence that the deal will go through is high, reflected by a potential $3 billion fee if it fails.\n\"With today's developments, execution is still important but they have a bit of breathing room,\" said Morningstar analyst Philip Gorham.\nAB InBev shares were up 1.6 percent. Analysts said the cost-conscious company would probably exceed its $1.4 billion savings target, having done so after previous acquisitions in the United States and Mexico.\n\"This is the estimate going in,\" said Bernstein Research analyst Trevor Stirling. \"This is guaranteed and there may well be potential for more.\"\nThe company said the biggest proportion of savings will come from combining headquarters and removing overlapping administration costs, but will also come from scale-based efficiencies in brewing, distribution and procurement.\nWhile the MillerCoors stake sale is aimed at satisfying U.S. regulators, it remains to be seen whether the new company will have to divest SABMiller's 49 percent stake in CR Snow, the largest brewer in China, where AB InBev already has about 14 percent of the market.\nAB InBev Chief Executive Carlos Brito declined to comment on China or its future as a bottler of PepsiCo drinks, given that SABMiller bottles Coca-Cola drinks.\nAlso unclear is the future of SABMiller's relationship with French wine maker Castel Group and stake in Turkish brewer Anadolu Efes.\nAB InBev's lead advisers are investment bank Lazard and law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer. SAB's advisers include Robey Warshaw, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley and law firm Linklaters.\n(Editing by Keith Weir and Susan Fenton)\nNext In Market News\n",

  "articleText" : "ARM Royalties Accelerate as Smartphone Market Gains Strength\nAmy Thomson\nFebruary 11, 2015 — 2:19 AM EST\nFebruary 11, 2015 — 3:24 AM EST\nARM Holdings Plc, the chip designer whose technology is in more than 95 percent of smartphones, reported accelerating royalty revenue growth as the market for quicker, more powerful handsets expanded.\nRoyalty sales in the fourth quarter advanced 13 percent, compared with 7 percent a year earlier, the Cambridge, England-based company said today in a statement. The company had said that type of revenue -- the fees ARM collects when customers use its technology -- would return to more “normal” growth levels in the fourth quarter after five slower quarters.\nThe acceleration will continue this year, driving a 10 percent increase in total sales, as measured in dollars, in the first three months, the company said. Faster, fourth-generation mobile networks are pushing customers to upgrade to new phones that take advantage of them, like Apple Inc.’s iPhone 6.\nLicense revenue, the upfront fee customers pay to access ARM’s technology and an indicator of future sales, rose 27 percent from a year earlier to $162.3 million in the fourth quarter.\nARM climbed 3.7 percent to 1,095 pence at 8:23 a.m. in London, taking the advance to 17 percent in 12 months.\nIndustrywide, smartphone unit sales increased 28 percent in the fourth quarter, helped by demand for less expensive devices in emerging markets, researcher IDC said last month.\nDiversified Products\nWhile industry growth is coming from cheaper handsets, the company’s newer designs are being incorporated in phones at all price points, Chief Financial Officer Tim Score said on a call today. More than half of chips using ARM technology are going into devices other than mobile phones as the company diversifies its product line, he said.\nARM unveiled technology this month that will give customers the ability to build processors with 50 times more power than top-tier smartphones had five years ago. The company is also making bets on alternative technology, adding designs and software for Web-enabled appliances , like connected streetlights and thermostats.\nTotal revenue in the quarter rose 18 percent to $357.6 million, or 225.9 million as reported in pounds. That compares with the 215 million pounds predicted by analysts on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nCompanies including Samsung Electronics Co. and MediaTek Inc. use ARM’s designs to make processors for phones. Qualcomm Inc. also uses ARM designs in some of its products and licenses ARM technology for use in ones it designs itself.\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.\n",

REUTERS/Neil Hall\nBy Ben Hirschler | LONDON\nLONDON GlaxoSmithKline said on Thursday its Chief Executive Andrew Witty would retire in 12 months after leading the British drugmaker through a series of changes since 2008 that have failed to ignite the share price.\nWitty, a 31-year company veteran, has been under pressure in the past three years as sales and profits have flagged, while some investors have questioned his focus on a consumer health business that ranges from headache pills to toothpaste.\nHis reputation was further tarnished by a damaging bribery scandal in China that landed GSK with a record 3 billion yuan  ($463 million) fine in 2014.\nOn the plus side, Witty has managed GSK through a wave of drug patent expiries without resorting to a major acquisition and the company is now on track to return to earnings growth this year.\nHis decision to retire at the end of March 2017 is not a huge surprise, since Chairman Philip Hampton had already discussed the need for succession planning in meetings with shareholders.\nBut the departure comes at a time of continued debate over the direction of GSK and investors may fear a period of limbo before a new CEO comes on board.\nThere have been calls from a minority of shareholders, including respected UK fund manager Neil Woodford, for a break-up of the group, with critics arguing its pharmaceuticals and consumer health units would do better as standalone businesses.\nWoodford said an outsider with a fresh perspective should now be appointed as Witty's replacement.\nWitty, 51, has conceded in the past that spinning off the consumer healthcare division could be an option but he has argued this should not happen in the short term.\nHe told Reuters on Thursday he remained convinced consumer products offered a valuable counterbalance to pharmaceuticals and insisted his retirement was unrelated to break-up demands.\n\"Absolutely you should not make that linkage. I can tell you the board is unanimously committed to the strategy and the structure of the group,\" he said.\nDeutsche Bank analyst Richard Parkes said that while a new CEO might turn to acquisitions to bolster GSK's prescription drugs - a move that could be funded by a sale or spin out of consumer operations - an evolution of the current strategy was more likely than major change.\nA $20 billion asset swap with Novartis, completed a year ago, which involved the exchange of cancer drugs for the Swiss group’s consumer health products and vaccines, was a centre-piece of Witty's time in charge.\nThe deal crystallized his idea of reducing exposure to premium-priced pharmaceuticals and increasing sales of over-the-counter products, as well as selling more lower-priced medicines in emerging markets.\nSTOCK UNDERPERFORMANCE\nNot all investors have been convinced by the diversification play, however, and GSK shares have underperformed, returning 87 percent since he took over in May 2008 against 164 percent on average for the European pharmaceuticals sector.\nRecently, GSK stock has done better, largely on the back of its HIV drug business, which the company had considered spinning off in an initial public offering before deciding to retain it.\nGSK said its board would consider both internal and external candidates for the role of new CEO. Executive search firms Egon Zehnder and Korn Ferry have been engaged to help with the appointment.\nInternal candidates could include GSK's global pharmaceuticals head Abbas Hussain, leader of the consumer division Emma Walmsley and manufacturing head Roger Connor, as well as finance chief Simon Dingemans, a former Goldman Sachs banker.\nExternally, GSK might try to snare a senior figure from a rival drugmaker, such as Novartis' respected pharma head David Epstein, or else look beyond the drugs sector to an executive with broader experience in consumer products.\nChairman Hampton also announced plans for \"board refreshment\" at the drugmaker, with Deryck Maughan, Stephanie Burns, Daniel Podolsky and Hans Wijers not standing for re-election at the annual meeting in May.\n(Additional reporting by Sarah Young; Editing by Mark Potter and Elaine Hardcastle)\nNext In Health News\n",

The layout and design of the formal dining room and interlinking study on the ground floor has been reinstated exactly as the Iron Lady had it during her 22 years at the property, from 1991 until her death in 2013.\n6/15 Tiny London house that is just 10ft wide goes on market for £800,000\nA tiny terraced house that measures no more than 10ft wide has gone on the market in south London for a staggering £800,000. The house, generally labelled \"unique\" by estate agent Foxtons, looks all the more unusual because it is sandwiched between two regular-sized homes. It doesn't even have a proper back door - images of the interior suggested renovators had sought to maximise the property's space by including a folding aperture to the similarly narrow back garden.\n7/15 The Mayfair penthouse that sold for £30 million\nA Mayfair penthouse on Albemarle Street, one of Mayfair's oldest roads, sold to a mystery buyer for £30 million in December. The 5,845 sq ft, three-bedroom family home is thought to be one of the most expensive properties sold in the capital this year, and comes with an annual service charge of £61,000.\nsupplied by Estate agent Peter Wetherell\n8/15 The dilapidated pre-fab 'shed' sold for nearly £1 million\nA pre-fabricated bungalow in south-east London has sold at auction for just under £1 million. The 1950s property in Peckham comes with 0.6 acres of land, is in need of renovation and has no fitted bathroom, but still sold for £950,000. A guide price of £590,000 was initially set, but increased rapidly during the bidding.\nGoogle Maps\n9/15 The starter home flats that went for a combined £60 million\nSome 215 “affordable” starter homes, specifically designed for first time buyers, sold out in just three hours in November, after dozens of aspiring homeowners camped overnight and queued in bad weather to get their hands on the flats. The starter home flats at Trinity Square by Galliard Homes went for a combined £60 million, or an average of £700 per sq ft. Londoners looking for affordable housing did not hesitate to camp out for up to two days to snag a flat, despite the fact that the project will not be complete for another two years.\nGalliard\n10/15 The longest lateral flat where H.G wells hosted a book club: yours for £3.65m\nThe 2,200 square foot apartment in Chiltern Court in Marylebone was also home to author Arnold Bennett and political cartoonist David Low. Now on the market for £3.65 million through Rokstone agency, the four-bedroom flat has been refurbished into a luxury apartment, providing an exceptional 40 meter window frontage and depth. It claims to be the longest and most outstanding lateral flat - ones that stretch the full width of a building, or sometimes across two buildings - currently for sale in London’s West End.\nRokstone\n11/15 Gatti House: the flats with celebrity links and private \"pizza\" lift that sold for a collective £16.5 million\nCelebrity links, a famous history and a private “pizza lift” has helped set a new record for price per square foot for a block of flats in central London. The four flats have sold for a collective £16.5 million at Gatti House on London’s Strand. Gatti House, a magnificent grade II building built in 1867, was sold as four separate apartments priced from £2.95 million to £5.95 million by CBRE Residential and Beauchamp, which has completed the last remaining sale.\nCBRE Residential and Beauchamp\n12/15 London’s most expensive office\nA newly refurbished office in the heart of Mayfair measuring 6,000 sq ft was unveiled by Enstar Capital in October. At £500 per sq ft, it is set to be the most expensive commercial fit out ever undertaken in the West End, according to the developer. The workspace on 54 Brooks Mews features gold-plated executive washrooms inspired by Armani-hotel in Italy, timber flooring imported from a 16th century monastery in Tuscany and an Art Deco entrance restored with a new “54” entrance logo replicating Steve Rubell’s famous “studio 54” nightclub logo from the seventies.

It was only spun off from Baxter International last month.\nIf Shire were to sweeten the offer, however, it might be open to negotiations, said one person familiar with the U.S. company.\nShare price fluctuations since Aug. 3 mean Shire's offer is currently worth around $42.50.\n($1 = 0.9139 euros)   (Additional reporting by Nishant Kumar and Greg Roumeliotis.

Wednesday’s win was the index’s second in a row. On Tuesday, it climbed 0.8%.\nOil: The benchmark sloughed off losses alongside an acceleration in gains for oil prices . West Texas Intermediate crude US:CLZ6 popped up by nearly 3%, to trade closer to $52 a barrel. Brent crude UK:LCOZ6  bounced up more than 2%.\nShares of oil producers BP PLC BP., -0.85% BP, -0.38%  and Royal Dutch Shell PLC RDSB, -0.31% RDS.B, +0.23%  followed that lead, pushing both up by 0.9%.\nOil extended its rally after the U.S. Energy Information Administration unexpectedly reported that weekly domestic crude supplies dropped by 5.2 million barrels . Analysts polled by S&P Global Platts expected a climb of 2.5 million barrel climb.\nOil prices had been higher earlier after Saudi Arabia’s oil minister Khalid A. Al-Falih said in London that market rebalancing will continue to aid the market’s recovery. He also said many non-OPEC countries are willing to join a potential deal to cut global oil output.\nMovers: But other shares on the FTSE 100 struggled Wednesday. Travis Perkins PLC shares TPK, +0.00%  sank 4.4% after the building-products supplier issued a profit warning as it grapples with slack demand. The company plans to shut down 30 branches.\n“It is clear that the result of the EU referendum has created significant uncertainty in the outlook for our end markets and we did experience weaker demand in the run up to and immediately following the referendum,” said John Carter, chief executive at Travis Perkins, in a statement.\n“In our view it is too early to precisely predict end market demand and we will continue to monitor the lead indicators we track and will react accordingly,” Carter said.\nThe company is “growing the top line despite a pretty challenging environment but it looks like the worst is yet to come in terms of the U.K. economy and the company is willing to act now to protect the bottom line,” said Neil Wilson, markets analyst at ETX Capital, in a note.\nMargin growth at the company may be constrained into the next 12 to 18 months as Travis Perkins is exposed to pound weakness as it buys products “from dozens of overseas countries,” said Wilson.\nIn other moves, shares of Reckitt Benckiser RB., +0.90%  fell 2.6% following disappointing quarterly sales growth from the maker of Air Wick air fresheners, French’s mustard and other consumer products.\nBHP Billiton PLC shares BLT, -0.37% BHP, +0.03% BHP, +2.28%  rose 0.5%.

Health-care stocks will do particularly well, he predicts.\nJobs report: The U.K.’s unemployment rate came in at 4.9%, steady over the three months to August, the Office for National Statistics said. That rate met market expectations. Wages continued to grow, by 2.3% both include and excluding bonuses, and employment rose to a joint-record high of 74.5%.\nIt is “reassuring to see that early indicators such as the number of vacancies have remained high some three months after the Brexit vote,” said Kallum Pickering, senior U.K. economist at Berenberg, in a note.\nBut the risk of a so-called hard Brexit could lead companies to trim their U.K. operations. “A bigger-than-expected rise in unemployment would in turn likely lead to a slowdown in nominal wage growth,” from around 2.3% currently on year-over-year basis.\nThe pound GBPUSD, +0.2088%  rose to $1.2331 shortly after the labor data, but eventually drifted back to $1.2277. Sterling late Tuesday bought $1.2293.\nInvestors are waiting for word from London’s High Court, which is reviewing a case that is challenging Prime Minister Theresa May’s power to trigger Article 50 without holding a vote in parliament. Article 50 kicks off Brexit talks with the European Union. The court said Tuesday it will rule on the case as quickly as possible.\nMore from MarketWatch\n",

  "articleText" : "Health News | Fri Jan 23, 2015 | 7:40pm EST\nFDA approves NPS drug, in move validating Shire takeover deal\nBy Toni Clarke\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved NPS Pharmaceuticals Inc's drug Natpara to treat a rare hormone disorder, validating a bet by Shire Plc, which recently agreed to acquire NPS for $5.2 billion.\nNatpara is designed to treat hypoparathyroidism, a condition in which the body's parathyroid gland does not secrete enough parathyroid hormone (PTH). The hormone works with vitamin D to regulate body calcium.\nAnalysts expect the drug to generate peak annual sales of $542 million by 2019, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nThe FDA approval is for patients who cannot be well-controlled on calcium supplements and active forms of vitamin D alone. It stipulates that the drug's label include a boxed warning that bone cancer has been observed in rat studies with the drug. NPS is also required to track patient use under a risk evaluation and mitigation program.\n\"All of that was well known and well anticipated, so there was for us no surprises in both the label and the follow-up requirements,\" said Shire Chief Executive Officer Flemming Ornskov.\nNPS said it plans to launch sales of the drug in the second quarter of this year, but declined to comment on what the price will be. Shire's acquisition of the company is expected to close in the first quarter.\nShire, which makes Adderall and Vyvanse for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, is seeking to expand its position in the field of drugs for gastrointestinal disorders and rare diseases.\nAbout 180,000 people globally suffer from hypoparathyroidism, according to New Jersey-based NPS. In about 40 percent of cases, the condition cannot be controlled with the current treatment of high doses of calcium and vitamin D.\nThat uncontrolled population is the audience that NPS initially plans to target, which in the United States is about 20,000 patients, the company said.\nLow levels of PTH can cause tingling in the fingers and toes, muscle spasms, fatigue, muscle aches, hair loss, dry skin, headaches, mood swings and memory problems.\nNatpara is a bioengineered version of the hormone itself.\nThe condition can be caused by congenital disorders or surgery.\nData from a late-stage clinical trial of Natpara showed that 53 percent of patients treated with the drug were able to reduce their calcium and vitamin D supplements by 50 percent or more, compared with 2 percent of placebo-treated patients.\nNPS has filed for approval of Natpara in Europe.\n(Reporting by Toni Clarke in Washington; Additional reporting by Deena Beasley in Los Angeles; Editing by Leslie Adler and Andrew Hay)\nNext In Health News\n",

REUTERS/Phil Noble\n2/2\nBy Ben Hirschler | LONDON\nLONDON French drugmaker Sanofi has poached one of AstraZeneca's top scientists to be its new research head in another high-profile departure for the British drugmaker.\nSanofi said on Tuesday that Yong-Jun Liu had been appointed as head of research with effect from April 1, reporting to Elias Zerhouni, the group's president of global research and development.\nLiu, a specialist in immunology with more than 250 published articles in leading academic journals, currently heads up research at AstraZeneca's MedImmune biotechnology division, a position he has held since 2014.\nZerhouni said his appointment would help the transformation of Sanofi from a pharmaceutical into a biopharmaceutical company, with a strong research presence in cutting-edge biotechnology.\nPrior to that he led program at Baylor Research Institute and the MD Anderson Cancer Center, where he was founding director of the Cancer Immunology Research Institute.\nHis decision to leave AstraZeneca follows the exit last June of Briggs Morrison, the company's former chief medical officer and head of late-stage drug development, and respiratory and inflammatory medicines head James Ward-Lilley.\nAn AstraZeneca spokesman declined to comment on his move.\nAstraZeneca is going through a transition as older drugs lose patent protection and it invests heavily in new medicines, especially in the field of cancer immunotherapy.\nIt has a promising pipeline of experimental drugs but has also suffered some recent setbacks, including last week's failure of its marketed heart drug Brilinta as a treatment for stroke patients and earlier disappointing results with a drug to treat lung and abdominal cancer mesothelioma.\nSanofi, meanwhile, is seeking to rejuvenate its early-stage pipeline and Zerhouni said Liu's experience in immunology, oncology and translational medicine would be \"vital assets\" for this task.\n\"He fits perfectly for us at this time,\" Zerhouni said in a telephone interview. \"We have the luxury of a full late-stage pipeline and therefore we can step back and invest for the long term.\"\nOncology is a particular priority. Sanofi may have missed the first wave of immunotherapy drugs that help fight tumors by removing brakes on the immune system, but Zerhouni hopes to \"leapfrog\" forward by focusing on new approaches and testing multiple cancer drug combinations.\n\"Immuno-oncology is just at the beginning of its development,\" he said. \"Frankly, I think it won't be enough to just remove a checkpoint inhibitor because it is also important to activate the immune system.\"\n(Editing by Jason Neely and Susan Thomas)\nNext In Science News\n",

These competitors continue to invest heavily for further growth.\"\nIt also said that there's increasing evidence that the threat against Croda's innovation leadership is increasing.\nExane BNP Paribas highlighted a number of risks in the Crop Care business specifically, including a customer base that's consolidating, as well as high inventories in the northern hemisphere after a weak 2015.\nIt said the company is no longer a cash generation machine.\n\"Working capital intensity (mainly inventories) has been increasing since FY11.

  "articleText" : "Whitbread sales sink in fourth quarter on Costa slowdown\nThu, 3rd Mar 2016 07:26\n(ShareCast News) - Sales slowed at Whitbread in the fourth quarter but the Premier Inns and Costa coffee shops owner said it would still deliver full year profit in line with expectations.\nAlthough like-for-like sales at the hotels and restaurants division increased 2.2% in the 11 weeks to 11 February, Costa like-for-likes slowed to 0.5%.\nCosta's slowdown from the 3.7% growth in the prior three quarters was blamed on lower footfall on the high street and the unusually warm winter.\nTotal like-for-like sales were ahead 1.7%, well below the 3.5% achieved in the third and second quarters.\nLike-for-like sales for the 50 weeks of the financial year so far being up 3.2% and total sales up 10.4%, down from 3.6% and 11.1% recorded in the first 39 weeks.\nHowever, chief executive Alison Brittain claimed it was \"another good trading period\", pointing to Premier Inn's total sales rising 7.3% with occupancy rising by 0.3% pts to 71.4% and rooms available increasing by 6.9%.\nThe hotel brand's like-for-likes were ahead of growth in revenue per available room (revpar) of 0.4% due to the \"substantial, higher returning, hotel extensions programme\" and reflecting a solid provincial market and declines in London.\n\"In the year ahead, as we build towards our growth milestones, we will continue to invest in improving our customer propositions, our digital and IT capabilities and in our winning teams to ensure we maintain our market leading positions,\" Brittain added. \"This will deliver long term profitable growth and sustainable returns for our shareholders.\"\nWhitbread pointed to investment in the customer proposition, digital and IT capabilities, with the group reiterating its intentions to invest £15m in 2016/17 along with capex in line with the current year at circa £700m.\nAnalysts at Shore Capital said although a weaker fourth quarter was expected the headline number was below its expectations of circa 2-2.5%.\n\"Although we would expect today's update to be taken negatively, certainly around the Costa performance, we recently upgraded our recommendation from 'hold' to 'buy' to reflect that the hotels were arguably being valued at or below replacement cost.\n\"The comment in the statement with regards potential sales & leaseback could be encouraging in demonstrating the value in the balance sheet.\"\nRelated Shares:\n",

  "articleText" : "GlaxoSmithKline share price slips as FDA okays asthma therapy only for adults\nAdditional data needed for approval for younger patients\nby Kate Smith Friday, 01 May 2015, 09:18 BST\nShares in GlaxoSmithKline Plc (LON:GSK) have slipped more than one percent in London this morning after the US regulator gave limited approval to the companyâ€™s Breo Ellipta asthma treatment, which it co-developed with San Francisco-based Theravance Inc (NASDAQ:THRX). The approval authorised that the treatment be given to adults only, despite the development of a version also targeting 12-17 year old patients.\nAs of 08:40 BST, GlaxoSmithKlineâ€™s share price had lost 1.16 percent to stand at 1,497.00p, underperforming the blue-chip FTSE 100 index which has lost 0.55 percent to 6,922.65 points so far in todayâ€™s session. The pharmcoâ€™s shares have shed about eight percent over the past year.\nGSK and Theravance announced in a joint statement this morning that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had approved their Breo Ellipta therapy for the once-daily treatment of asthma in patients aged 18 years and older. Breo is a fixed-dose combination of two compounds, administered  once daily using the Ellipta dry powder inhaler. The therapy is already approved in the US as a treatment for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\nThe companies noted in the statement that the FDA had issued a complete response letter related to the proposed use of Breo Ellipta in patients aged between 12 and 17 years, stating that the data submitted did not show an adequate risk-benefit ratio to support the approval in those patients. The US regulator pointed out that additional data would be required to further demonstrate the safety and efficacy in that age group.\nRespiratory drugs are one of GSKâ€™s key areas with the company expecting total sales of its respiratory portfolio to return to growth next year.  The London-listed drugmaker is scheduled to update investors on its first-quarter performance on May 6. Last month, FTSE 100 peer AstraZeneca Plc (LON:AZN) posted a drop in quarterly revenue and earnings .\n",

  "articleText" : "Det norske and BP join forces to grow Norway’s leading independent oil and gas producer\nDet norske and BP join forces to grow Norway’s leading independent oil and gas producer\nDate: 10 June 2016\nDeal creates strategic platform for long-term growth in Norway, combining Det norske’s efficient operating model with BP’s experience and technical expertise\nBP and Det norske oljeselskap today announced the creation of Aker BP ASA, an independent oil and gas company combining the assets and expertise from both companies’ Norwegian exploration and production operations to form the largest Norwegian independent oil and gas producer.\nBP group chief executive Bob Dudley commented: “BP and Aker have matured a close collaboration through decades, and we are pleased to take advantage of the industrial expertise of both companies to create a large independent E&P company. The Norwegian Continental Shelf represents a significant opportunity going forward and we are looking forward to working together with Aker to unlock the long term value of the company through growth and efficient operations. This innovative deal demonstrates how we can adapt our business model with strong and talented partners to remain competitive and grow where we see long-term benefit for our shareholders.”\nUnder the terms of the proposed transaction, the BP Norge and Det norske businesses will combine and be renamed Aker BP ASA. Aker BP will be independently operated and listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. Aker BP will be jointly owned by current Det norske shareholder Aker (40%), other Det norske shareholders (30%) and BP (30%). BP will also receive a cash payment of $140 million plus positive working capital adjustments as part of the transaction.\nØyvind Eriksen, chairman of the board of directors in Det norske commented: “Aker BP will leverage on Det norske’s efficient operations, BP’s international capabilities and Aker’s 175 years of industrial experience. Together, we are establishing a strong platform for creating value for our shareholders through our unique industrial capabilities, a world-class asset base, and financial robustness.”\nThe completion of the transaction, which is expected by the end of 2016, is subject to customary closing conditions, regulatory review and approval by Det norske shareholders. All of BP Norge’s roughly 850 employees will transfer to the combined organization upon completion of the deal.\nIn addition to the attractive combination of the two companies’ Norwegian asset portfolios, Aker BP will benefit from the combined strength of Det norske’s efficient, streamlined operating model and BP’s long experience in Norwegian offshore operations, asset knowledge, technical skills and international experience. The companies believe this new Norwegian super-independent could organically grow production to more than 250,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by the early 2020s.\nAbout Det norske\nHeadquartered in Trondheim, Det norske oljeselskap ASA is a rapidly growing independent exploration and production company with exploration, development and production activities on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. Det norske merged with Aker Exploration in 2009 and acquired Marathon Oil Norway in 2014. It employs about 550 people.\nDet norske is the operator of producing fields Alvheim, Volund, Vilje and Jette. The company is also the operator of the large Ivar Aasen development. The company is also a partner in the Johan Sverdrup field, one of the largest on the Norwegian continental shelf.

Aker owns 49.9% of Det norske (oil and gas producer) along with significant ownership stakes in Aker Solutions (oilfield services) and Kvaerner (oilfield construction) amongst other interests.

Top executives have also been asked to cut down on travel this year.\n\"What we see ahead is very sobering,\" Walsh said in the memo that was first cited by a trade publication, Australian Mining.\n\"This situation is not temporary and our industry is moving into the new normal which means we must continue to be one step ahead,\" according to the memo to Rio staff.\nWalsh said the industry had faced pressure from weak global growth after the 2009 financial crisis and now due to slowing growth in China as it transitions from an infrastructure and construction-led economy to one driven by consumers.\n\"The pressure this is placing on our industry is significant and it is important we recognize that the pressure isn't going to let up,\" Walsh said.\nRio has been slashing costs ever since Walsh took the reins three years ago and is seen to be better off than its peers, having cut debt sharply after nearly sinking under loans it took on for an ill-timed $38 billion takeover of Alcan in 2007.\n\"In fact, this challenging market presents an opportunity to widen the gap between us and our competitors,\" Walsh said.\nA Rio Tinto spokesman declined to comment on the memo.\n(Reporting by Sonali Paul; Editing by Himani Sarkar)\nNext In Big Story 10\n",

We will now continue to move further and faster in 2016 to clean-up the bank and improve our core businesses,\" said Ross McEwan.\nRBS said it will also it will write down £498m from its private bank Coutts, due to various factors including expectations of a reduction in future profitability due to the continuing low interest rate environment, a higher tax rate, margin pressure and higher capital allocations.\nGary Greenwood, analyst at ShoreCap, said while such headlines are disappointing it wasn't a total surprise and RBS has the balance sheet strength to comfortably absorb the costs.\n\"To us, this action represents a further cleaning up exercise in the RBS investment story and something that therefore helps to remove uncertainty and improve transparency,\" Greenwood said.\n\"Adjusting our end December 2015 tangible net asset value per share forecast for this announcement would see it reduce to 354p, but with the shares already trading at a 27% discount to this level, we reiterate our positive stance. Buy.\"\nExane BNP Paribas has cut Croda International from 'neutral' to 'underperform', citing tougher competition, slower growth and lower margins.\nThe investment bank said on Wednesday that the competitive environment the chemicals company operates in has structurally changed.\n\"Croda attributes its growth 'soft patch' in FY13-14 to slower end-markets, and less ingredient innovation by HPC customers,\" it noted.\n\"Yet our benchmarking analysis suggests peers weathered these headwinds better. These competitors continue to invest heavily for further growth.\"\nIt also said that there's increasing evidence that the threat against Croda's innovation leadership is increasing.\nExane BNP Paribas highlighted a number of risks in the Crop Care business specifically, including a customer base that's consolidating, as well as high inventories in the northern hemisphere after a weak 2015.\nIt said the company is no longer a cash generation machine.\n\"Working capital intensity (mainly inventories) has been increasing since FY11. Capex at 2-2.5x depreciation for the next two years implies a significant near-term headwind.\"\nCroda International's target price was also cut from 2,880p to 2,500p.\nSage's first quarter management statement contained both positives and negatives and with the stock trading at a slight premium to its sector Panmure Gordon reiterated its recommendation to 'hold'.\nOn the upside, the business software provider reiterated its fiscal year guidance and there was an up-tick in organic revenue and net debt, analyst George O'Connor said in a research note sent to clients.\nFurthermore, the company was confident on the outlook for fiscal year 2016, projecting an increase of at least 6% in organic revenue and operating margins of 27%, he said.\nHowever, the company made no comment on the US, where there had been at least one high-profile departure.\nAlso on the negative side of the ledger, the outfit was focused on customer acquistion with more subscribers typically coming in at the lower end of the low value products range, as it focused on customer acquisition at the entry level, O'Connor explained.\nIt had begun a price war in that segment, which entailed the risk that customers would flip-flop between competing offers, O'Connor added.\nHistorically, the company had a poor record in terms of customer renewals as it pursued M&A and then \"milked\" the customer base of the companies it acquired, the analyst said.\nNevertheless, O'Connor stood by his target price on the shares of 594p.\nRelated Shares:\n",

ICE has a put or shut up deadline of March 29 to launch a rival bid. \nThe structure of the deal is unchanged with LSE shareholders ending up with 45.6% of the as yet unnamed new group and Deutsche Börse holders with 54.4%. But Rolet denied this meant the Germans would dominate.\n“The new company will be a UK plc headquartered in London and will pay tax in this country,” he said. “The biggest group of shareholders in both companies are American and British investors own 20% of Deutsche Börse while Germans only own 15%.”\nStock Exchange chairman Donald Brydon will chair the merged business with Deutsche’s Joachim Faber his deputy and Kengeter chief executive. The LSE’s David Warren will be finance director and each side will put up a further six non-executive directors.\nNick Goodway: We need LSE boss Xavier Rolet to stay in Britain\nDeutsche Börse has tried to buy the LSE twice — in 2000 and 2005 — and could still face major competition issues with the deal unlikely to be sealed until late this year or early in 2017. \nKengeter said that a vote by the UK to leave Europe would not alter the terms of the merger but that they had already set up a committee “to respond to any regulatory or legal changes needed”.\nHe said: “This combination enables Europe to maintain and enhance its position in global capital markets in the long term.” Together the two businesses had income of £3.4 billion last year against ICE’s £3.1 billion, Nasdaq’s £2.2 billion and CME’s £2.2 billion. \n“I always wanted the LSE to end up in a safe, globally relevant place,” said Rolet. “If the price of that for me was to bow out so be it.”\nMore about:\n",

At any rate, it has certainly allowed Diageo to move ahead of its rival SABMiller in performance terms for the year so far.\"\nKeith Bowman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said there was a feeling that for companies, growth was not easy to find as the economy was still growing at sub-par levels. He said the market could see some potentially bigger takeovers or mergers to kick-start things again.\nThe blue-chip FTSE 100 index was down 0.04 percent at 6,801.47 points by 1345 GMT, after falling to a two-month low in the previous session. The index fell 2.6 percent last week, its biggest weekly drop so far this year, but is still up more than 3 percent so far this year.\nAmong the top fallers, Shire dropped 1.8 percent after a Sunday Times report suggesting the pharmaceutical company was considering a 12 billion pound ($18 billion) takeover of Actelion Ltd, Europe's biggest biotech firm. Actelion shares jumped 8.9 percent.\nBritish grocers also slipped, with Morrisons down 0.4 percent after announcing price cuts on Monday. It had announced in March 2014 that it would allocate 1 billion pounds ($1.5 billion) towards lowering prices over three years.\nLike rivals Tesco, Wal-Mart's Asda and Sainsbury's, Morrisons is lowering prices in a bid to stem the flow of shoppers turning to discounters Aldi  and Lidl.\nTesco shares fell 1 percent.\n(Additional reporting by Liisa Tuhkanen; Editing by Catherine Evans)\nNext In Hot Stocks\n",

  "articleText" : "Add Your Note (Optional):\n \nLONDON (Alliance News) - Glencore PLC Wednesday said it has revised down its capital expenditure budget for 2015 in response to \"the volatile market backdrop\" and said production rose across the board during 2014, as it announced it will divest its stake in Lonmin PLC in the first half of 2015.\nIn December, the mining and oil company had laid out a USD7.9 billion capital expenditure budget for 2015, which has now been revised down to between USD6.5 billion and USD6.8 billion.\nGlencore said it will divest from its 23.9% stake in platinum miner Lonmin during the first half of 2015 by distributing Lonmin shares to Glencore shareholders. Glencore acquired the stake in Lonmin through its acquisition of Xstrata PLC in May 2013, and said it has always classed the stake as \"non-core\" because the company does not trade in platinum or have any \"special insight\" into the market.\n\"It is currently proposed that the divestment in Lonmin will be implemented by way of a distribution in specie to Glencore shareholders. This distribution, currently representing 3 cents per Glencore share, will not impact Glencore's approach towards its annual cash distribution consideration,\" said the company.\nLonmin responded with its own statement, saying: \"Glencore's proposal is a constructive way forward which would enable Glencore shareholders to continue their participation in Lonmin's future.\"\nGlencore experienced a rise in production across all of its commodities in 2014, apart from zinc which remained flat from 2013. The increase was mainly attributable to the acquisition of Xstra and Caracal.\nGlencore's own-sourced copper production for 2014 totalled 1.5 million tonnes, up 4% from 2013 and mainly driven by a ramp-up at the Mutanda mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The production increase was offset by average copper prices falling 6% to USD6,866 per tonne from USD7,328 a year earlier.\nOwn-sourced nickel production was up 3% year on year to 101,000 tonnes after increased production at the Koniambo mine and increased grades at the Raglan mine in Canada. Average nickel prices rose by 13% from 2013 to USD16,892 per tonne from USD15,012.\nOwn-sourced ferrochrome production rose by 5% from 2013 to 1.3 million tonnes, reflecting the ramp-up at the Lion phase 2 project in South Africa, which is expected to reach full capacity by the middle of 2015, Glencore said.\nOwn-sourced coal production totalled 146.3 million tonnes, up 6% from 2013 after a series of productivity improvements across its coal portfolio in Australia. Glencore said it shutdown its Australian coal operation in December 2014 and January 2015 \"in response to the subdued market environment\".\nOwn-sourced zinc production was the only commodity not to experience an increase during 2014, remaining flat from a year earlier at 1.4 million tonnes. However, nickel production was up 12% quarter on quarter. Average zinc prices increased by 13% year on year to USD2,164 per tonne in 2014 from USD1,909.\nGlencore's oil entitlement rose year on year by 47% to 7.4 million barrels in 2014, caused by the Alen and Badila assets recording their first full-year of production and the company increasing its stake in its assets in Chad following the Caracal acquisition.\nThe company said the Managara field in Chad, which began producing in December, will see a steady ramp-up in 2015.\nGlencore shares were up 0.3% to 271.90 pence per share on Wednesday morning.\nBy Joshua Warner; joshuawarner@alliancenews.com; @JoshAlliance\nCopyright 2015 Alliance News Limited.

If they do decide to leave the UK, the plan will be put to shareholders to make the final decision.\nMartin Walker at Invesco Perpetual said the bank is right to consider leaving - as long as it can find a better alternative location.\n\"It is the right question to ask at this stage in the regulatory cycle. The pendulum has swung too far in terms of punitive regulation of banks, and where international banks have an option, then they are duty bound to their shareholders to explore those options,\" said Mr Walker.\n\"With any move to any new jurisdiction you would clearly need to weigh up the benefits versus the potential idiosyncrasies of the new jurisdiction. It is a balancing act, but clearly if HSBC felt that it was beneficial to be domiciled somewhere else, then that would be a move I would support.\"\nDouglas Flint, HSBC chairman\nStandard Life's Mr Cumming said UK banking regulations have rightly been tightened up, but have now gone too far and so HSBC should leave.\n“Obviously we need stress tests, and banks should have prudent capital,” Mr Cumming said. But regulators had engaged in a “never ending process” of continually bludgeoning banks as they approach the last target set for them, he said.\nThey are continually “moving the goalposts”, Mr Cumming said. If HSBC did decide to move, “I think a lot of shareholders … would be supportive of that, given the current situation in terms of regulation”, he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.\nStandard Life is the 12th biggest shareholder in HSBC, and holds a 1.06pc stake in the bank according to Bloomberg data.\nMr Cumming said: “Given the situation, where there is no clear end point in terms of ever increasing capital requirements , and the fact that they are being put at a competitive [dis]advantage, and the fact that we will see better growth, earnings and dividend prospects unless the regulator changes tack then logically we would be supportive of a move if they chose to do that.”\nBut Filippo Alloatti from Hermes disagreed, noting that the British tax regime has improved since the government promised to trim the bank levy in the summer Budget, and that \"concerns about the outlook for the Chinese economy\" could also make a move less appealing.\n\"I don't think they will shift their HQ away from the UK. Being domiciled in the UK comes at a cost but banks are subject to regulatory scrutiny you don't have in China and Hong Kong,\" he said.\n\"Also a bank the size of HSBC will remain a global systemically important bank, no matter of domicile,\" indicating it will still be subject to tighter global rules on capital buffers and charges wherever the bank moves.\n",

  "articleText" : "Funds News | Mon Jun 8, 2015 | 1:57pm EDT\nUPDATE 3-Stifel to buy former Lehman brokerage from Barclays\n(Adds analyst quotes, updates shares)\nBy Richa Naidu and Jed Horowitz\nJune 8 U.S. investment bank Stifel Financial Corp said on Monday it would buy Barclays Plc's  U.S. wealth and investment management unit, which is largely made up of the former brokerage arm of Lehman Brothers.\nThe deal value was not disclosed, but Barclays said the sale would have minimal financial impact. ( bit.ly/1F3YltV )\nStifel is hoping to bring on board the unit's 180 advisers, who manage about $56 billion from offices in 12 cities.\nThis compares inauspiciously with the 250-300 advisers that Barclays executives said were working a year ago. A spokesman declined to specify historic numbers.\nDepending on the number of advisers who ultimately join Stifel, the deal could contribute $200-$325 million to revenue, Stifel Chief Executive Ron Kruszewski said on a conference call.\nKruszewski has paid relatively low prices to buy companies in the past, but often provides generous packages to retain their employees.\nIn talking up the complimentary \"entrepreneurial\" cultures of the firms during the call, Kruszewski appeared to be speaking as much to Barclays brokers as to the financial community.\nStifel will be allowed to exclusively sell certain Barclays-underwritten stock and bond offerings to retail investors, a major business of many of the Barclays brokers.\n\"At the mid-point of guidance, it appears this transaction could be double digit percent accretive to 2016 EPS,\" Wells Fargo Securities analyst Christopher Harris wrote in a note, but he added that this depended on adviser retention.\nSt. Louis-based Stifel, a once low-key firm specializing in municipal bonds, is now a national presence serving individual investors and middle-market companies.\nKruszewski, who became CEO in 1997, has bought several, mostly troubled, retail brokerage and investment banking firms since 2005.\nStifel closed the acquisition of Alabama-based Sterne Agee Group for about $150 million on Friday. S&P Capital IQ analyst Ken Leon said Sterne Agee would likely generate $300-$325 million in revenue, raising his target price by $5 to $65.\nSources told Reuters in May that Barclays was reaching out to potential buyers for its U.S. wealth business.\nKruszewski said Stifel would cut costs by combining some back-office operations and closing branches where the firms have duplicate locations.\nStifel said it expected pretax margins of between 20-25 percent after amortization of retention, and that it would issue between 1 million and 2 million shares.\nThe deal is expected to close in November, Stifel said.\nStifel's shares were up 0.7 percent at $57.45 in early afternoon trading.

  "articleText" : "Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and Lloyds Banking Group Plc are the two major U.K. lenders most exposed to the commercial real estate market, which poses a risk for banks after asset managers\nfroze withdrawals from property funds, JPMorgan Chase & Co. said.\nRBS has 25.2 billion pounds ($33 billion) of lending to the sector, accounting for 66 percent of its tangible net asset value, a measure of capital, and Lloyds has 18.1 billion pounds, or about 46 percent of its TNAV, Raul Sinha, an analyst, said in a report dated July 5. While the risks for major banks are “manageable,” small lenders could see greater losses because of higher loan-to-value ratios on their CRE debt.\n“Downside risk from U.K. commercial property prices is likely to pressure domestic U.K.-exposed bank valuations,” Sinha wrote. “Major U.K. banks have broadly maintained their underwriting standards in recent years, with smaller banks and building societies including challenger banks having a relatively high proportion of more highly leveraged CRE loans.”\nThis week, three asset managers halted withdrawals from real-estate funds after investors rushed to redeem money as concern grows about the future of the British economy. The pound has dropped to a 31-year low less than two weeks after the nation voted to leave the European Union. The Bank of England said Tuesday it was “closely monitoring” valuations in the commercial real-estate market and moved to ease banks’ capital requirements.\nMore Stress\nThe shock caused by the freezes in the real estate funds may prompt more redemptions from investors, putting them under more stress, Morgan Stanley told clients in a report. The analysts said 45 percent of investors in the funds weren’t British and therefore would also be suffering from the devaluation of the pound.\nA collapse in prices would “hurt Lloyds and RBS particularly badly; both have large commercial property loan portfolios, and the coming falls in commercial property price indices will translate into higher required impairment provisions against them,” Cenkos Securities analyst Sandy Chen said in a separate report sent Wednesday, which reiterated sell ratings on both lenders.\nThe industry as a whole has 86 billion pounds of commercial real estate lending, “reduced significantly” from five years ago, when it totaled more than 150 billion pounds, JPMorgan said. The major banks have 69 billion pounds of exposure and smaller banks and building societies hold the remaining 17 billion pounds. Societe Generale SA analysts echoed Sinha’s warning smaller challenger banks were most at risk due to high leverage.\nBanks will be shielded from losses of the scale seen in the 2008 and 2009 financial because they’ve shrunk their portfolios and lent a smaller portion of the property’s value, analysts at HSBC said. Risk-aversion, new regulations and recent increases in property prices account for the change, Ivan Zubo and Robin Down wrote in a note to clients.\nJPMorgan cut its 2018 earnings per share estimates for U.K. banks by 22 percent last week.\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann\n8/8\nBy Joshua Franklin , Carolyn Cohn and Lisa Jucca | ZURICH/LONDON/HONG KONG\nZURICH/LONDON/HONG KONG Credit Suisse has swooped on Prudential boss Tidjane Thiam to lead the Swiss bank in a push to manage more of the wealth held by Asia's fast growing club of multi-millionaires.\nThiam, a 52-year-old former Ivory Coast government minister, will replace American chief executive Brady Dougan, who has drawn fire for failing to reform the bank and scale back its risky investment banking business fast enough.\nIn a sign of Thiam's standing with investors, news of his move added almost $3 billion to Credit Suisse's market value on Tuesday and cut Prudential's by nearly $2 billion.\nAs Prudential (PRU.L) boss - and the first black head of a FTSE 100 company - Thiam has built up a strong Asian track record, expanding the British-based insurer's sales in the region since 2009 and trebling its share price in the process.\nWhile Thiam has never run a bank, shareholders and analysts regard his experience in dealing with financial regulators as a strength while lenders must implement a blitz of new rules imposed following the global financial crisis.\nDougan, 55, had been criticized for not paring back Credit Suisse's CSGN.VX investment bank enough after the introduction of global regulations forcing banks to hold more capital so that they could survive another crisis.\nChairman Urs Rohner said the bank would press on with its current strategy under Thiam, a multi-linguist whose private interests range from soccer to Russian literature.\n\"As you know, we have a strategy of growing the wealth management business,\" Rohner said, adding that he wanted a more balanced allocation of the bank's capital between the wealth management and the investment banking businesses. \"It is not about a fundamental redirection,\" he told a news conference.\nThiam was guarded on his plans. \"Credit Suisse has been successful but I don't know an organization that doesn't need change,\" he said. \"There are things that need to be improved. I'm not in a position to go any further in the answer.\"\nCredit Suisse's shares closed up 7.76 percent, adding $2.93 billion to its market value, while Prudential's lost 3.1 percent, wiping $1.99 billion from its capitalization.\nHe was hailed as a star by the Swiss media, with tabloid Blick dubbing him the \"Obama of Credit Suisse\" whose appointment was a sign of Switzerland's openness to the world.\nTages Anzeiger said Thiam might be much better suited to lead Credit Suisse than Dougan, an outsider in Switzerland whose departure was \"long overdue\".\nUnder Dougan, Credit Suisse survived the crisis without resorting to a taxpayer-funded bailout. But he faced calls to quit last year when the bank reached a $2.5 billion settlement with U.S. authorities for helping Americans to evade taxes via secret bank accounts.\nHe will leave at the end of June after 25 years at the bank and eight as CEO, when he was one of the world's highest-paid bankers with his salary topping 90 million Swiss francs ($91 million) in one year. More recently, he had embarked on several rounds of cost-cutting.\n\"Thiam has no banking experience but it could be that an outsider can make some of the decisions they were not able to make internally,\" said one investor in Credit Suisse, who asked not to be named.\nThiam left Ivory Coast in his early 30s following a coup and joined consulting firm McKinsey & Co in Paris - making him now the third ex-McKinsey member on Credit Suisse's 10-strong executive board. People who have worked with him said he has a sharp intellect and deals well with regulators and colleagues.\nWhile at Prudential, Thiam failed in an attempt to take over Asian-focused insurer AIA (1299.HK) in 2010 after a shareholder rebellion. Nevertheless, he successfully concentrated on Asia to drive profits.\nHis recruitment raises expectations that he will cut Credit Suisse's investment bank hard at last. Its European rivals such as UBS UBSG.VX have been faster to shrink this business and focus on other areas of strength.\n\"Thiam's background in insurance and asset management suggests Credit Suisse's focus is moving increasingly away from investment banking,\" said a UK-based fund manager, who was reviewing his position after selling the bank's shares on concerns about capital requirements.\nBUILDING BRIDGES\nDougan's departure leaves JP Morgan's (JPM.N) Jamie Dimon and Goldman Sachs's (GS.N) Lloyd Blankfein as the only two global banking CEOs still in place since the 2008-09 crisis.\nThe Credit Suisse board backed Dougan over the U.S. settlement, under which the bank pleaded guilty to criminal charges but kept its New York license. However, he was criticized by some politicians and media in Switzerland.\nThiam has the languages to help build bridges with Swiss politicians wary of bankers after having to bail out UBS. He addressed his first Credit Suisse news conference in German and French as well as English.\nA fan of English football club Arsenal, he lists \"The Brothers Karamazov\" by 19th century Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoyevsky as his favorite book and his top song is Tadieu Bone by Ismael Lo, a guitarist from Senegal, his father's country.\nAsked on a BBC radio show two years ago how he felt leading people, Thiam said: \"It's a bit like walking a tightrope because you feel all these expectations around you and it's rarely comfortable. If you really believe in what it is you are trying to achieve it helps you go through a journey and walk without looking down.\"\nPrudential, Britain's largest insurer by market value, confirmed Thiam's departure as it reported a 14 percent rise in operating profit in 2014.\nThe firm said a successor has been identified and would be announced after the regulatory approval process. Thiam is expected to remain in place until after first quarter results are released in May. The insurance group declined to comment on media reports that its U.S. business head Mike Wells would get the job.\n($1 = 0.9898 Swiss francs)\n(Additional reporting by Ismail Shakil in Bengaluru, Denny Thomas in Hong Kong, David Henry in New York, Alexander Smith, Sinead Cruise and Steve Slater in London and Edward Taylor in Zurich; Editing by Sophie Walker, David Stamp and Giles Elgood)\nNext In Money\n",

Unilever plc (LON: ULVR), British American Tobacco plc (LON: BATS) and PZ Cussons plc (LON: PZC).However, Unilever continues to have significant long-term growth potential. China is forecast to increase its consumption of consumer goods at a rapid rate and this bodes well for Unilever’s top and bottom lines. Furthermore, Unilever has exposure to a wide range of markets so that if one geographic region disappoints, it has a number of others that can pick up the slack.\nBritish   American   Tobacco  is a great  stock  to own in times like these because  of   the   defensive  nature of  tobacco  companies  and   the  huge profit the company has consistently delivered for years.  Centric has  defensive  qualities like the other  stocks  mentioned here but there is also considerable scope for capital growth.  Centrica  is reporting this week so that may give us some confirmation  of   the  companies change in fortunes  and   the  outlook going forward.

Centric has  defensive  qualities like the other  stocks  mentioned here but there is also considerable scope for capital growth.  Centrica  is reporting this week so that may give us some confirmation  of   the  companies change in fortunes  and   the  outlook going forward.\n© Provided by Fool Centrica, Gas ring burning\nThe EU referendum is going to have an unprecedented effect on the markets. It’s likely we’ll see increased volatility leading up to and after the vote on 23 June. These defensive shares should offer some stability to a portfolio and investors should be considering moving some capital into defensive investments.\nUtility powerhouse\nCentrica (LSE: CNA) is a classic defensive stock and should hold up well over the next few weeks. I also think the stock offers considerable scope for growth in the next few years. The company pays a chunky dividend yield of 5.5% and trades on a forward 2016 price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 12. This is below its peers and illustrates that the company is somewhat undervalued. It surprisingly raised £700m in May to make two acquisitions and pay off some debt. This was a smart move by the company and shares are now trading above the placing price. Centrica is also set to divest a number of upstream oil and gas assets in the next few years, which should lead to lower costs. These divestments could also bring cash into the business, which may lead to further dividend increases.\nJ Sainsbury plc, Next plc & British American Tobacco plc: blue-chip bargains or value traps?\nRoyston Wild considers the investment appeal of FTSE 100 (INDEXFTSE: UKX) stocks J Sainsbury plc (LON: SBRY), Next plc (LON: NXT) and British American Tobacco plc (LON: BATS).Supermarket strains\nBritish   American   Tobacco  is perhaps the epitome of a  defensive  play, returning value to shareholders through even the worst  of   the  2008-2009 financial crisis.  Consumer staple giants Reckitt Benckiser  Group  (LSE: RB),  British   American   Tobacco  (LSE: BATS) and Diageo (LSE:DGE) have each seen share sell-offs in the first weeks of 2016. These companies sell products that people  buy  in bull and bear markets alike, enjoy pricing power due to premium brands, and have proven over the decades their ability to reward…\nRoyston Wild looks at the dividend prospects of  British   American   Tobacco   plc  (LON: BATS),  Centrica   PLC  (LON: CNA) and John Wood  Group   PLC  (LON: WG).  Cigarette play  British   American   Tobacco  (LSE: BATS) cheered the market during Thursday’s session after releasing better-than-expected financial results for 2015. The London firm advised that revenues slipped 6.2% last year to £13.1bn, with adverse currency movements driving the top line lower.\nTobacco king\nIn the face of lower tobacco volumes and fewer smokers British American Tobacco (LSE: BATS) is still growing revenues and profits. Tobacco companies have always made solid defensive stocks and have outperformed the wider market since January. British American Tobacco is the biggest tobacco company in London and it trades on the highest P/E of 18.3. This looks expensive but the company has significant growth potential. E-cigarettes are becoming ever more popular and should drive revenues in the future. British American Tobacco also owns some hugely important and recognisable global cigarette brands. The company is focusing on these brands and this is boosting volumes, revenues and profits.\nSoftware giant\n3 hot recovery stocks? Centrica plc, Genel Energy plc and Sports Direct International plc\nAre these three stocks on the cusp of stunning comebacks? Centrica plc (LON: CNA), Genel Energy plc (LON: GENL) and Sports Direct International plc (LON: SPD).However, with Centrica having a sound strategy through which to turn its financial performance around, now could be a good time to buy it. That’s not to say that further share price falls can be ruled out, but rather that in the coming years it could beat the performance of the wider index.\nNational Grid  plc   and   Centrica   plc  are still great investments! Alan Oscroft | Thursday, 19 May, 2016.  3  defensive   stocks  for income: National Grid  plc , SSE  plc & Primary Health Properties  plc .  2 steady  stocks  for  the   EU   referendum : National Grid  plc   and  Dignity  plc .  Royston Wild explains why National Grid  plc  (LON: NG),  British   American   Tobacco   plc  (LON: BATS) and JD\nCentrica  was created in 1997 when  British  Gas  plc  demerged into  Centrica   plc   and  BG  plc  (later BG  Group   plc ). The demerger  grouped   British  Gas's gas supply, services, retail businesses and gas production business  of   the  Morecambe gas fields under  Centrica .  Centrica  is the largest supplier of gas to domestic customers in the UK, and one  of   the  largest suppliers of electricity, operating under the trading names \"Scottish Gas\" in Scotland and \" British  Gas\" in the rest  of   the  UK.\nSage (LSE: SGE) shares are another classic defensive play and should be much less volatile than indices in the next few weeks. The software provider has also performed well over the last six months but I’m not sure this will continue in the long term. Sage released impressive first half results in May which saw revenue up 6.2% and operating profit up 1.9%. The dividend yield has slipped to just 2% and the company is trading on a forward P/E ratio of 20 for 2017.  It has good prospects and earnings are set to grow in the future but I think the shares are well valued. Even if the company doesn’t grow rapidly it’s still defensive and should hold up during increased times of volatility.\nThese three shares may not be the best long-term investments but can be used as important ways to shelter cash during volatile times. After the EU referendum, shares should fall less on a leave vote but still rally on a remain vote. This can be a great tool for investors to use in times of uncertainty.\nCould Netsuite and Sage link up in the next big tech deal?\nSpeculation has emerged that Microsoft’s planned US26.2bn tie-up with LinkedIn could spark more tech-sector takeovers, with Sage Group plc (LON:SGE) a potential winner or loser in any deal. The next big merger could be a takeover of cloud computing specialist NetSuite Inc (NYSE:N) or Ultimate Software Group Inc. (NASDAQ:ULTI), according to a Bloomberg report. And the speculation has continued, with market gossips tipping London-listed accountancy software firm Sage to be among those eyeing Netsuite, which develops business management software systems. But they say Sage is likely to be up against big competition for the California-based firm, with other possible suitors said to include IBM (LON:IBM), Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google, Salesforce.com Inc and SAP SE (ETR:SAP). Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), which already owns 40% of NetSuite, is also thought to be watching the situation closely. Rumour has it that some of the interested parties have even approached major NetSuite shareholders, who are said to be unlikely to accept less than US&dollar;120 a share. But sector watchers reckon Sage could lose out if Oracle buys the whole of NetSuite, sells it to a rival or enters a joint venture with a new shareholder. A market source said: “If Oracle or someone else buys NetSuite, it’s not good news for Sage.” Sage said late last year that it still had much to do in its restructuring despite reporting higher revenue and subscriptions.\nShould  income-seekers pile into  Centrica   plc  (LON: CNA), BAE Systems  plc  (LON: BA) and  British   American   Tobacco   plc  (LON: BATS) right now?  However, with  British   American   Tobacco  having excellent pricing power, it has been able to increase prices and generate higher sales and profitability. Looking  ahead , there looks likely to be more  of   the  same in this regard and with the company’s Vype e-cigarettes continuing to offer long-term growth potential, the prospects for  British   American   Tobacco ’s dividend growth are very upbeat.\nThese 3  stocks  could offer much more potential than their sector peers:  British   American   Tobacco   plc  (LON: BATS),  Centrica   plc  (LON: CNA) and GKN  plc  (LON  That’s because their potential rewards may substantially outweigh their risks  and   the  resulting margin of safety could lead to stunning share price gains in the long run. As such, it could be worth backing  stocks  of this kind to a greater extent than some of their index peers.\nInvestors who want to beat the market regularly and make consistent profits must read this free report.\nThe Motley Fool's expert analysts have written a report to give investors the edge by using 10 steps to make a million in the market.\nThe report will help investors make lasting returns.

The Financial Times reported the testimony in an article on its website dated Sunday.\n“We want to make it crystal clear that we will not tolerate improper business conduct of any sort and will take all necessary action to ensure compliance,” a spokesman for Rolls-Royce said in an e-mailed response today to the article.\nPetrobras, the state-run oil producer, is mired in Brazil’s biggest graft scandal, with accusations that company executives took bribes from a cartel of construction companies and shared the proceeds with politicians. The case is being investigated by Brazilian securities authorities, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and external lawyers hired by the company.\nRolls-Royce is already under investigation by the U.K. Serious Fraud Office for potential wrongdoing in business dealings in Asia.

REUTERS/Rick Wilking\nWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Friday said it has boosted its holdings in some of the billionaire's favorite companies, including Wells Fargo & Co and International Business Machines Corp.\nThe changes were disclosed in a regulatory filing detailing Berkshire's U.S.-listed stock portfolio as of March 31.\nBerkshire also boosted its share stake in U.S. Bancorp, another large holding, while other portfolio managers adjusted their stakes in several companies.\nNo new stocks were added to the portfolio, which shrank to $107.1 billion from $109.4 billion in December. Berkshire bought $1.62 billion and sold $1.11 billion of equities overall.\nBuffett has long praised his \"Big Four\" stock holdings Wells Fargo, IBM, Coca-Cola Co and American Express Co, which comprise roughly 58 percent of Berkshire's equity investments.\nBuffett has stuck with them despite recent adversity including IBM's stagnant stock price, concern over Coca-Cola's sugary products and executive pay structure, and a February court ruling that American Express violated antitrust law.\n\"Too many fund managers are more interested in seeing stocks to which they have committed perform well\" in the short term, said Andy Kern, a University of Missouri professor who teaches a class on Buffett's investment strategies. \"Berkshire has such a long time horizon that it can afford to watch the stock price go down so it can buy more.\"\nFriday's regulatory filing does not disclose who makes which investment at Berkshire. Smaller investments are often made by portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who may succeed Buffett as chief investment officers after he departs.\nIn the first quarter, Berkshire raised its stake in Wells Fargo by about 2 percent to 470.3 million shares, and in IBM by roughly 3 percent to 79.6 million shares. The U.S. Bancorp stake grew about 5 percent to 83.8 million shares.\nOther holdings that grew include Deere & Co, Liberty Global Plc, Phillips 66, Precision Castparts Corp and Twenty-First Century Fox Inc.\nHoldings declined in Bank of New York Mellon Corp, Charter Communications Inc, National Oilwell Varco Inc, Viacom Inc and Wabco Holdings Inc.\nBerkshire also owns more than 80 businesses, including the Burlington Northern railroad, Dairy Queen ice cream and Geico car insurance.\nBuffett, 84, this month celebrated his 50th anniversary running his Omaha, Nebraska-based company, whose market value is fifth-highest among publicly-traded U.S. companies.\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli and Andrew Hay)\nNext In Money\n",

The proposed $85 billion tie-up between telecoms giant AT&T (T.N) and media conglomerate Time Warner (TWX.N) revived hopes the British commercial broadcaster could be again pursued by cable operator Liberty Global (LBTYA.O). Liberty raised its stake in ITV to 9.99% in the summer but said it did not intend to launch a bid.\nSmaller rival STV Group ( STVG ) led the FTSE Small Cap index after jumping nearly 9%, or 35p, to 435p after activist investment fund Crystal Amber ( CRS ) lifted its stake in the former Scottish Television to over 10%.\nProvident upgrade\nBack in the FTSE 100, Provident Financial ( PFG ) was the blue chip index’s biggest riser, up 3.3% or 99p to £31.04, after Goldman Sachs raised its target price for the consumer credit company to £30 from £25.70.\nEasyjet ( EZJ ) gained 2.8%, or 25.5p, to 943.5p, after UBS upgraded its stance on the budget airline to ‘buy’ from ‘neutral’, though it cut its share price target to £10.50 from £10.70.\nBritish American Tobacco ( BATS ) shed 1.7%, or 78.5p, to £45.87 after credit agency Fitch put its rating on ‘negative watch’ with a view to a possible downgrade following its merger bid with US rival Reynolds on Friday.\nDrug stocks were under pressure with Hikma Pharmaceuticals ( HIK ) and Shire ( SHP ) falling 1.7% and 1.9% respectively.\nCobham crash\nOutside the FTSE 100, Cobham was the biggest faller on the mid-cap FTSE 250 index, plunging 26p or 16% to 134.4p after its second profits warning this year. The aerospace and defence company cut its profit forecast citing weak demand for its electronics products. Trading profits are expected to be between £255 million and £275 million compared to analysts’ consensus forecast of £291 million.\nFrench Connection ( FCCN ) enlivened the smaller companies market as shares in the struggling fashion retailer shot up nearly 15%, or 5p, to 37.5p after the Sunday Telegraph reported that private equity firms were considering making a bid.

These are familiar stories of big companies recalling products because of new – unintended – changes to the recipe.\nKraft is the latest company to make headlines for recalling a product - 6.5 million of them in fact. It asked customers to return 7.25-ounce packets of its hallmark mac and cheese with a best before in September and October this year in the US, Puerto Rico and the Caribbean after metal bits were discovered in the food by eight separate customers.\nKraft's share price closed down two per cent after the announcement but is since back up to trading at prior levels - suggesting investors were barely alarmed by the news.\nHistory seems to show that though product recall may affect the public perception of a brand, it does not hurt its prospects with investors.\nKraft Singles\nMac and Cheese was not the first Kraft product recall. In August it recalled 7,700 cases of some varieties of Kraft American Singles after a supplier failed to store an ingredient correctly. Back then the share price dipped for two days but was back to pre-recall levels less than a month later.\n \nCadbury\nIn 2006 Britain's beloved chocolate-maker Cadbury-Schweppes recalled more that one million chocolate bars after contamination from a leaking pipe at a Cadbury factory resulted in a salmonella outbreak that infected nearly 40 people. That summer, sales of Cadbury's chocolate fell 14 per cent while Cadbury reported the incident would cost them a hefty £20 million in recall costs, advertising and manufacturing improvements.\nFruit Shoot\nBritvic recalled Fruit Shoot, a brand of children's fruit drink, after a six-year-old boy nearly choked on a loose cap in 2012. A week after the incident, Britvic's share price had slumped 13.4 per cent. By the end of the year, the recall cost Britvic £16.8 million.\nSpecial K\nSome cereal-eaters found their Special K had an extra crunch in February 2013 after glass fragments were found in the Kellogg's cereal. The company pulled 36,000 packets from supermarket shelves as a precaution. Kellogg's shares tanked 13 per cent on the day of the announcement but by the time of the company's third quarter results, profits had gone up because of cost cutting measures that could have resulted in the lax factory standards in the first place.\nHorse meat\nIrish food inspectors found traces of horse meat in frozen beefburgers made in the UK and Ireland in mid-January 2013, resulting in Tesco, Asda and Nestle products being recalled, among others. Tesco blamed the scandal for a one per cent drop in sales in May, however shares in Sainsbury's, Morrison's and Tesco all rose between nine and 16 per cent in the following weeks, indicating that investors and customers alike had brushed off the risks.\n",

REUTERS/Phil Noble\nBy Ben Hirschler | LONDON\nLONDON Novo Nordisk and AstraZeneca, two drugmakers whose financial outlooks disappointed investors last month, are both hoping for a boost in the coming weeks from results of two closely watched clinical trials.\nAstraZeneca wants to prove its blood-thinner Brilinta can help stroke patients, in addition to those with heart problems, while Novo aims to showcase the cardiovascular benefits of its blockbuster diabetes treatment Victoza.\nWhile positive outcomes are not guaranteed, industry analysts believe AstraZeneca may have the easier task.\nIts so-called SOCRATES trial is assessing whether Brilinta can do better than aspirin, the current standard of care, in preventing recurrent attacks in the 90 days after patients suffer a stroke.\nHistory suggests it has a good chance, since Sanofi's now off-patent drug Plavix previously showed limited benefit in stroke and Brilinta is more potent. The main risk is that Brilinta might cause more dangerous bleeding.\nA positive result would boost consensus forecasts for Brilinta, which currently stand at an annual $1.8 billion for 2020, according to Thomson Reuters Cortellis.\nThat is well short of AstraZeneca's own projection of $3.5 billion by 2023, but Deutsche Bank analysts believe the addressable market for Brilinta could double if SOCRATES and another study in peripheral artery disease (PAD), due in the second half of 2016, both hit their goals.\n“We started with the heart but this could be the year when we go beyond the coronary setting by addressing the head and strokes, and also open another chapter with the limbs through addressing the possible treatment of PAD,” said Ludovic Helfgott, head of AstraZeneca's Brilinta business.\nAstraZeneca has so far only promised stroke results sometime in the first half of 2016. However, its study was due to complete last month, according to clinicaltrials.gov, suggesting initial headline findings may emerge relatively soon.\nResults from Novo's cardiovascular trial known as LEADER, the Danish firm's largest clinical study to date, are due before the end of March.\nNovo is under pressure to prove its drug can cut the danger of heart attacks and strokes, after the unprecedented success of Eli Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim's Jardiance pill in slashing deaths in diabetics with heart risk.\nChief Science Officer Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen said in an interview in November that Victoza, which sold $2.6 billion in 2015, almost certainly does have heart benefits. But he's not 100 percent sure if these will be apparent in the relatively sick patients enrolled in LEADER.\n(Editing by Susan Thomas)\n",

REUTERS/Benoit Tessier\nBy Kristen Hays and Erwin Seba | HOUSTON\nHOUSTON Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and Saudi Aramco announced plans on Wednesday to break up Motiva Enterprises LLC in a deal that ends a partnership of nearly two decades and hands control of the biggest U.S. refinery to the Saudi state oil giant.\nNews that the two energy companies will divide assets in their oil refining and marketing joint venture had been expected by many as they navigated an often-frayed relationship where their respective interests sometimes diverged.\nAn early sign of a pending breakup emerged last summer when Motiva announced plans to set up its own oil products trading operation separate from Shell. The desk started up in January.\nThe divorce also comes as the Saudi government considers selling shares in the world’s largest oil firm.\nAbdulrahman Al-Wuhaib, senior vice president of downstream at Saudi Aramco, said in a statement on Wednesday that the joint venture formed in 1998 served the partners' downstream business objectives \"very well for many years.\"\n\"It is now time for the partners to pursue their independent downstream goals,\" he said.\nA U.S. spokesman for The Hague-based Royal Dutch Shell said the breakup and split of Motiva's assets were consistent with Shell's plans to simplify its global portfolio.\nPROPOSED BREAKUP TERMS\nMotiva's three refineries in the U.S. Gulf Coast region have a combined capacity of over 1.1 million barrels per day, located within a 120-mile (195-km) radius of one another. The marketing operations support a network of about 8,300 Shell-branded gasoline stations in the Eastern and Southern United States.\nThe partners said that under the terms of a non-binding letter of intent, Aramco would take over the Port Arthur, Texas, refinery and retain 26 distribution terminals as well as the Motiva name.\nIt will also have an exclusive license to use the Shell brand for gasoline and diesel sales in Texas, the majority of the Mississippi Valley, the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic markets, it said.\nShell will solely own the Louisiana refineries in Convent and Norco, where it also operates a chemicals plant, as well as Shell-branded gasoline stations in Florida, Louisiana and the Northeastern region.\nA Shell spokesman said the company would move forward with Motiva's plan to integrate the Louisiana refineries to operate as a single 500,000-bpd plant.\nLONGTIME TENSION\nWhile sources close to the situation say the relationship between Shell and Aramco has been troubled, that tension grew after an ambitious $10 billion expansion of Motiva's flagship Port Arthur refinery. The project doubled its size to 603,000 barrels a day and surpassed Exxon Mobil Corp's (XOM.N) Baytown, Texas, plant as the country's largest.\nA disastrous leak of caustic fluid in a new unit crippled the plant shortly after top executives from Shell and Aramco unveiled the expansion in May 2012, upping the cost that already had ballooned from $5 billion.\n\"That was a continuation of the bad blood,\" said a person familiar with the relationship.\nIn February 2014, Motiva hired Dan Romasko, who had been the top operations executive at refiner Tesoro Corp (TSO.N), to replace former top Shell trading executive Bob Pease as chief executive.\nRomasko told Reuters in an interview a year ago that Motiva was \"coming into its own\" after the company announced plans to integrate the two Louisiana refineries.\nSources familiar with the relationship also said Aramco was said to be angry at Shell when refinery workers at the three Motiva plants went on strike in early 2015.\nShell led negotiations with the United Steelworkers union representing the workers, and the strike ended three weeks after the Motiva walkout.\n(Additional reporting by Liz Hampton in Houston and Josephine Mason and Jessica Resnick-Ault in New York; Editing by David Gregorio, Sandra Maler and Peter Cooney)\nNext In Commodities\nIran optimistic on OPEC deal after meeting Algerian minister\nDUBAI Iran is optimistic OPEC can reach a deal on limiting oil supplies and plans to announce its own decision about any output curbs at the group's meeting next week, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on the ministry's official website SHANA.\nSaudi wants OPEC to solve own problems before meeting non-OPEC\nDUBAI/LONDON Top OPEC oil exporter Saudi Arabia has told the producer group it will not attend talks on Monday with non-OPEC producers to discuss limiting supply, OPEC sources said, as it wants to focus on having consensus within the organization first.\nShell CEO expects no valuation hit from climate accord\nAMSTERDAM Royal Dutch Shell expects to pump out all the fossil fuel reserves listed on its balance sheet, its chief executive said, dismissing concerns that production limits in the wake of the Paris climate accord could hit the energy giant's valuation.\nMORE FROM REUTERS\nFrom Around the Web Promoted by Taboola\nTrending Stories\n",

REUTERS/Stefan Wermuth/Files\nBy Steve Slater | LONDON\nLONDON Lloyds Banking Group (LLOY.L) will be able to buy back bonds early, potentially saving it about 1 billion pounds in interest payments as a result of a court ruling.\nLloyds said on Thursday the Court of Appeal had unanimously backed its request to buy back bonds, called enhanced capital note (ECNs), from investors at their par value.\nThat should allow the bank to save on expensive interest payments worth 200 million pounds each year over about five years.\nThe decision overturned a ruling by a High Court judge in June, who said Lloyds could not buy the bonds back early.\nLloyds shares were up 1.6 percent by 1130 GMT, the top performing major European bank stock.\nBut prices on the bonds slumped in the secondary market, reflecting the expectation they would be bought back at par value. A $328.95 million (£217.2 million) bond that pays 7.875 percent annual interest, which is the biggest ECN Lloyds has said it wants to buy back, dropped by 10 points to 100.1 from 110.6, according to Tradeweb.\nThe ECNs were issued by Lloyds in 2009, shortly after it was bailed out with 20.5 billion pounds by the UK government, and pay high annual interest of between 6 and 16 percent.\nThe hybrid bonds convert into capital if the bank's capital ratio falls. But Lloyds said new UK and European capital rules meant the ECNs would no longer count as core capital and so it wouldn't provide the cushion they were supposed to, so it wanted to buy them back at face value.\nBecause of the high interest they paid, the bonds were popular among retail investors seeking higher yielding investments, and some hedge funds and asset managers. Some of the investors called on the courts to block the buyback, sparking a long-running dispute.\nThe bank issued about 8.3 billion pounds of the ECNs and has exchanged about 5 billion pounds worth of them for new instruments, leaving about 3.3 billion pounds of the notes outstanding.\nLloyds said on Thursday it intended to buy back 600 million pounds of the notes, as previously announced in December, most of which were due to mature in 2019/20. It will consider whether to buy back its other remaining ECNs.\n(Additional reporting by Helene Durand Editing by Jeremy Gaunt)\nNext In Business News\n",

  "articleText" : "Tesco share price: Brand Guarantee comes under fire\nUK advertising watchdog to scrutinise new price-matching scheme amid promotion concerns\nby Deyana Ivanova Monday, 19 Oct 2015, 08:32 BST\nTesco (LON:TSCO) is expected to come under fire over its new price-matching scheme, which is said to flout a ruling the supermarket giant was responsible for putting in place.\nTesco has revamped its Price Promise scheme as Brand Guarantee, which immediately reduces the price of a customerâ€™s shop at the till if it would have been cheaper at any of its â€˜big fourâ€™ rivals -- Asda, Sainsbury's (LON:SBRY) and Morrisons (LON:MRW). Launching the new initiative last week , Tesco said that the enhanced strategy was designed to remove the â€œstressful and awkwardâ€� voucher system, where shoppers were handed money-off vouchers for their next shop rather than an immediate discount.\n[Free Guide] Are UK Grocers Set for Imminent Growth?\nIt is understood, however, that rivals argue the promotion of Brand Guarantee fails to make clear that customers are entitled to a refund only if they buy more than 10 different products, including at least one branded product, and that it only matches against its â€˜big fourâ€™ rivals, rather than the wider retail sector. The advertising campaignâ€™s slogan, â€œNever pay more for your branded shopâ€�, is also said to fall foul of Advertising Standards Agency (ASA) guidelines because the supermarket will give a refund only if the whole branded basket is cheaper elsewhere.\nThe scrutiny of Britainâ€™s biggest supermarket comes almost a year after it won a legal battle over claims that its â€˜Price Promiseâ€™ advertising was misleading. Rival Sainsbury's complained to ASA last year about Tesco's marketing campaign, arguing that it was unfair to compare own-brand items on price alone and not take account of provenance and other ethical issues.\nTescoâ€™s share price edged higher at the opening bell this morning. As of 08:14 BST, the stock was trading 0.56 percent better off at 198.05p, slightly outperforming the FTSE 100, which meanwhile stood 0.38 percent up at 6,402.11 points.\n",

Analysts speculated the change puts Rowe, who has been with M&S for more than 26 years, in pole position to succeed group Chief Executive Marc Bolland when he decides to depart.\n\"One of the interesting aspects of this story is that it now seems more widely accepted among the press that current CEO Marc Bolland will leave the company in the foreseeable future whether it succeeds or not in the coming Autumn/Winter clothing season,\"  BESI Research analyst Tony Shiret wrote in a note.\nIn other fallers, GlaxoSmithKline dropped 1.1 percent after UBS cut its price target to 1400 pence from 1500 pence.\nOn the upside, online gambling firm 888 Holdings  rose 4.5 percent after the company said it had agreed to buy larger rival Bwin.party Digital Entertainment in a cash and stock deal worth nearly 900 million pounds ($1.40 billion).\n\"If 888 acquires bwin.party it will create a materially larger business with cost and revenue synergies to extract,\" Numis analysts said in a note.\n\"There is relatively little overlap: 888's core market is the UK whereas Germany is bwin.party's largest single market. bwin.party's principal product is sports betting whereas 888 is more focused on casino and poker.\"   (Editing by Toby Chopra)\nNext In Hot Stocks\n",

Ongoing market volatility means it is not the right time for a retail offer.\nThe move is all part of the government’s commitment to returning the state-owned banks to the private sector and get taxpayers’ money back. The government has already raised around £16.9 billion for the taxpayer from previous Lloyds share sales.\nA trading plan will ensure the government gets back all of the £20.3 billion that taxpayers injected into Lloyds during the financial crisis.\nThe decision follows advice from UK Financial Investments ( UKFI ) that selling shares through the trading plan represents good value for money for taxpayers. In their advice to the Chancellor UKFI said:  “Putting in place a further trading plan represents the best opportunity to sell shares at a price which delivers value for money for the taxpayer.”\nPDF , 62.5KB, 1 page\nThis file may not be suitable for users of assistive technology.

Sign up to follow, and we’ll e-mail you free updates as they’re published.\nYou’ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published.\nYou’re all set!\nBy Aaron Gregg August 11, 2015 Follow @Post_AG\nGaithersburg, Md., drug company MedImmune, the research arm of pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca, announced that it is buying a not-yet-approved cancer treatment in a deal that could be worth $727 million. The drug, named INO-3112, fights cancer by bolstering the body’s immune response to tumors.\nMedImmune is joining a host of companies that are jumping into an emerging field called immunotherapy, which involves treatments that target a person’s immune system.\n“Our ultimate objective is to make chemo, radiation and surgery a thing of the past,” said Joseph Kim, chief executive of Inovio, the Pennsylvania biotech company that developed INO-3112.\nThe license’s price tag underscores the risk big pharmaceutical companies will take for a chance to sell the next big thing.\nMedImmune agreed to pay $27.5 million up front for the license and $700 million in additional payments should the drug reach certain milestones. If it does hit the market — and the Food and Drug Administration is still in the early stages of the approval process — Inovio will get a small but significant cut of the sales revenue, starting below 10 percent and climbing over the two-digit mark as sales increase.\nImmunotherapy is an emerging field with a crowded pool of players, several of which are throwing huge piles of money around. Last week, Emergent BioSolutions of Rockville, Md., announced plans to pour $50 million to $70 million in cash into a new company based around its own immune-therapy drug.\nMedImmune’s scientists think the future of oncology is unlikely to be cornered by one or two miracle drugs. Instead, the company wants to piece different treatments together to form a whole.\n“We believe combinations are going to be transformative. The idea is to develop different drugs that target different mechanisms,” said David Berman, MedImmune’s recently appointed head of oncology.\nLately the company has been in expansion mode, adding new drugs and treatments to its arsenal by brokering partnerships with other companies. In April, it announced a collaboration with Celgene , a pharmaceutical company focusing on blood-related cancers. That same month it announced a deal with Seattle-based Juno Therapeutics , also focusing on cancer treatments. And just last week it unveiled a collaboration with California biotech company Mirati Therapeutics , which developed a cancer treatment that changes the way genes express themselves.\n“This field is moving so fast that I don’t think any one company can hold the entire keys to the kingdom,” Berman said.\nbusiness\n",

REUTERS/Jim Young\nNEW YORK Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) on Tuesday disclosed a 5 percent stake in agricultural equipment maker Deere & Co (DE.N) and said it shed a $3.74 billion investment in oil company Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) as oil prices plunged.\nThe changes were among several that Berkshire made in its common stock investments in the fourth quarter, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing detailing the conglomerate's domestic equity investments as of Dec. 31.\nBerkshire began accumulating the bulk of its 17.1 million-share stake in Deere, worth $1.51 billion at year end, in the third quarter of 2014, but had not previously disclosed it. The SEC often lets Buffett quietly accumulate large stakes to deter copycats.\nDeere shares rose 1.2 percent in after-market trading.\nShares of companies often rise after Berkshire reveals new investments because some investors consider it a vote of confidence by Buffett and try to copy him.\nDeere declined to comment.\nBerkshire's decision to dispose of its entire 41 million-share stake in Exxon Mobil was unusual for Berkshire because the stake had been recently acquired, dating only to 2013.\nExxon shares have outperformed many peers in recent months, losing only about 15 percent of their value from June through January as oil prices slumped by more than half.\nIt is unclear why Buffett appeared to have soured on Exxon, or whether Berkshire made money on the investment.\nBuffett \"is of course a value investor, and the fact of the matter is that Exxon shares held up extremely well during the oil price meltdown,\" said Raymond James energy analyst Pavel Molchanov in an interview.\nExxon Mobil declined to comment.\nBerkshire also reported a new stake of 4.7 million shares in Rupert Murdoch's media company Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O).\nIt further reported a new 8.4 million-share stake in Restaurant Brands International Inc (QSR.N) (QSR.TO), the parent of the Burger King and Tim Hortons restaurant chains. Berkshire helped finance Burger King's purchase of Tim Hortons last year and got Restaurant Brands shares through the merger.\nBerkshire also added to holdings in IBM Corp (IBM.N), General Motors Co (GM.N), Phillips 66 (PSX.N), Suncor Energy Inc (SU.TO) and DirecTV DTV.O, among others, and shed stakes in oil company ConocoPhillips (COP.N) and pharmacy benefits management company Express Scripts Holding Co (ESRX.O).\nU.S. regulators require large investors to disclose their stock holdings every quarter.\nBerkshire, based in Omaha, Nebraska, owns more than 80 businesses ranging from Dairy Queen ice cream to Geico insurance to the BNSF railroad.\n(Reporting by Luciana Lopez and Jonathan Stempel; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)\nNext In Business News\n",

Analysts predicted $1.25, the average of 18 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The company raised its profit forecast for the year.\nChief Executive Officer Erez Vigodman rattled the pharmaceutical industry last week with the Mylan bid, which would create a giant in generics with more than $27 billion in sales. With Teva’s best-selling product, the multiple-sclerosis drug Copaxone, losing patent protection this year, Vigodman has accelerated cost reductions as he looks for deals to replace the revenue Teva may lose.\nMylan rejected the offer, saying it’s too low and the companies have conflicting cultures. The purchase would immediately boost Teva’s generics division, which had a sales drop in the second half of last year and has lost U.S. market share to lower-cost manufacturers.\nSales fell 0.4 percent to $4.98 billion, above the average analyst estimate of $4.81 billion. Revenue from generic drugs increased 9 percent to $2.6 billion, aided by sales of its copy of Nexium, the AstraZeneca antacid treatment. Teva in January received approval to market a generic version of the drug.\nRevenue from Copaxone decreased 14 percent in the quarter to $924 million.\nEven so, the Israeli company delivered “strong organic growth through solidifying its base business,” David Maris, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets in New York, wrote in a note. “This was a good quarter for Teva.”\nCheaper Generics\nBesides the potential of cheaper generics, Copaxone, an injection that brings in about half of Teva’s profits, faces competition from newer oral drugs. To hold on to its market share, Teva has converted 67 percent of U.S. patients to the patented, three-times-a-week formulation that it introduced in the first quarter last year.\nThe company’s American depositary receipts fell 2.3 percent to $60.64 at 11:24 a.m. in New York. They have returned 8.6 percent including dividends this year as of yesterday’s close, trailing the 21 percent return for the Bloomberg Europe Pharmaceutical Index.\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

  "articleText" : "After Barclays and Bank of America, Citigroup has blockchain in sight\nBy Anirban Sen , ET Bureau | Updated: Sep 01, 2015, 10.02 AM IST\nREAD MORE ON » JP Morgan | global banks | Fiat | Citigroup | Barclays | Bank of America\nBENGALURU: Citigroup is looking to tap into the potential of blockchain, the underlying technology that powers virtual currencies such as bitcoin, and is also experimenting with the idea of its own fiat-backed digital currency, a top executive of the United States headquartered banking and financial services company said.\nThe company has joined other global banks such as Barclays and Bank of America that are also betting big on blockchain technology, which is widely being seen as the biggest technology disruption in the world of traditional financial services.\nFiat money is currency that derives its value from government regulations.\n\"On the blockchain, there are two parts that interest us. One is, today we are one of the largest movers of money -up to $1 trillion or more on a daily basis -because we're the only bank that ac tually operates in 100 coun tries. So, there is obviously an opportunity around our own general ledgers,\" said Aditya Menon, managing director of global digital strategy at Citigroup.\nMenon further said: \"We like the idea of a cryptocur rency that doesn't have vol atility. We are experiment ing with the idea of a fiat-backed digital curren cy -backed by a pound or a dollar or euro as the case may be. So, there is some in terest there.\"\nThe company's bet on blockchain comes at a time when the traditional bank ing and financial services industry is facing rapid disruption from the rise of new-age payments banks, mobile wallets and cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.\n\"For us it's not so much about bitcoin because bitcoin is something that has very volatile value, questionable in terms of an entry in and entry out from a regulatory perspective. But if you think about the distributed ledger -that is extremely valuable,\" said Menon, who also heads application programme interface development at Citigroup. Traditional banks like Citi and JP Morgan are scrambling to play catch-up with new-age fintech companies that are starting to leverage blockchain technology .\nAccording to a July report from the International Business Times, Citigroup has built its own digital currency based on bitcoin and the blockchain called CitiCoin.\nExperts see blockchain technology as hugely disruptive since it completely overhauls the traditional methods of transacting and maintaining online records, and allows banks and people to directly exchange money without having to rely on the additional, more expensive layers of middlemen.\n\"Blockchain gives you the ability to not only update a distributed ledger but settle it, which otherwise is a laborious process especially if you're doing it across multiple countries and times zones, etc. So there is one opportunity there,\" said Menon. He said trade finance is another area, citing the example of open-account trading.\"There is a last-mile hostage situation where money , documents need to change hands. So, if you use a distributed ledger to actually record ownership of title of the goods and then that changes hands based on the payments -that's a great example of how you can use blockchain technology to facilitate a trade transaction, which otherwise has been done in a very manual-intense way,\" he said.\nAt the company's research and development labs in Dublin, a team of researchers and executives are currently experimenting with the use of blockchain in traditional financial services.\nA number of regulators have also started looking at blockchain as a viable alternate way to run real-time payments and settlements, said Menon.\nStay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!\nDON'T MISSany stories, follow us on Twitter Follow\nFROM AROUND THE WEB\n",

It is a crucial phase of growth and development because experiences during early childhood can influence outcomes across the entire course of an individual’s life (1,2). For all children, early childhood provides an important window of opportunity to prepare the foundation for life-long learning and participation, while preventing potential delays in development and disabilities. For children who experience disability, it is a vital time to ensure access to interventions which can help them reach their full potential (1,3). Despite being more vulnerable to developmental risks, young children with disabilities are often overlooked in mainstream programmes and services designed to ensure child development (4). They also do not receive the specific supports required to meet their rights and needs. Children with disabilities and their families are confronted by barriers including inadequate legislation and policies, negative attitudes, inadequate services, and lack of accessible environments (5). If children with developmental delays or disabilities and their families are not provided with timely and appropriate early intervention, support and protection, their difficulties can become more severe—often leading to lifetime consequences, increased poverty and profound exclusion. The Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) (6) and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) (7) highlight how children with disabilities have the same rights as other children—for example to health care, nutrition, education, social inclusion and protection from violence, abuse and neglect. Ensuring access to appropriate support, such as early childhood intervention (ECI) and education, can fulfil the rights of children with disabilities, promoting rich and fulfilling childhoods and preparing them for full and meaningful participation in adulthood (4). This discussion paper provides a brief overview of issues pertaining to early childhood development (ECD) and disability. It lays the foundation for a long-term strategic and collaborative process aimed at improving the developmental outcomes, participation and protection of young children with disabilities. Essential to this effort is dialogue between United Nations agencies and relevant stakeholders to identify sustainable strategies which build on existing efforts, and expand on multisectoral approaches to guarantee the rights of young children with disabilities and their families.         \u000E2. Children with Disabilities What is disability and who are children with disabilities? Our understanding of disability and who people with disabilities are has evolved considerably over time. The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health: Children and Youth Version (ICF-CY) regards disability as neither purely biological nor social but instead the interaction between health conditions and environmental and personal factors (8). Disability can occur at three levels:  an impairment in body function or structure, such as a cataract which prevents the passage of light and sensing of form, shape, and size of visual stimuli;  a limitation in activity, such as the inability to read or move around;  a restriction in participation, such as exclusion from school. The CRPD states that “persons with disabilities include those who have long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments which in interaction with various barriers may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others” (7).  The term children with disabilities will be used throughout this paper. Some children will be born with a disabling health condition or impairment, while others may experience disability as a result of illness, injury or poor nutrition. Children with disabilities include those with health conditions such as cerebral palsy, spina bifida, muscular dystrophy, traumatic spinal cord injury, Down syndrome, and children with hearing, visual, physical, communication and intellectual impairments. A number of children have a single impairment while others may experience multiple impairments. For example a child with cerebral palsy may have mobility, communication and intellectual impairments. The complex interaction between a health condition or impairment and environmental and personal factors means that each child’s experience of disability is different.  While the identification of children with developmental delay (see Box 1 below for definition) or disabilities is critical for the development of policies, strategic planning and service provision, it is important to acknowledge that children with disabilities rarely think of themselves as disabled. Therefore working with children with disabilities requires carefully tailored approaches. Labelling a child solely in terms of their health condition should be avoided. They are children first and aspire to participate in normal family and peer-group activities.   How many children with disabilities are there?  WHO and the World Bank estimate that more than a billion people live with some form of disability, which equates to approximately 15% of the world’s population (5). Among these, between 110 million (2.2%) and 190 million (3.8%) adults have very significant difficulties in functioning (5).  There are currently no reliable and representative estimates based on actual measurement of the number of children with disabilities (9,5). Existing prevalence estimates of childhood disability vary considerably because of differences in definitions and the wide range of methodologies and measurement instruments adopted (5,10). The limitations of census and general household surveys to capture childhood disability, the absence of registries in most low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), and poor access to culturally appropriate clinical and diagnostic services contribute to lower estimates (10). As a result many children with disabilities may neither be identified nor receive needed services (5). What are the rights of children with disabilities?  The CRC applies to all children in the world, including children with disabilities. It spells out the basic human rights that children everywhere have: the right to survival; to develop to the fullest; to protection from harmful influences, abuse and exploitation; and to participate fully in family, cultural and social life. It also recognizes the importance of family assistance and support (6). Two articles make specific reference to children with disabilities: Article 2 outlines the principle of non-discrimination and includes disability as grounds for protection from discrimination; Article 23 highlights the special efforts States Parties must make to realize these rights (6).  In General Comment 9, the Committee on the Rights of the Child which oversees the implementation of the CRC has provided guidance to States Parties in their efforts to implement the rights of children with disabilities, covering all the provisions of the Convention (11). In addition General Comment 7 (12) and General Comment 9 (11) of the CRC specifically highlight that children with disabilities: are entitled to active participation in all aspects of family and community life; require equal opportunities in order to fulfil their rights; and should be treated with dignity at all times. Furthermore, they state that children with disabilities “are best cared for and nurtured within their own family environment” (11) and they “should never be institutionalized solely on the grounds of disability” (12). States Parties must protect children with disabilities from discrimination and provide access to a range of services and supports which are specifically designed to help them achieve their full potential. This was reinforced in the 2010 UN General Assembly Resolution A/65/452 (13).  Similarly, the more recent CRPD includes an article dedicated to addressing the rights of children with disabilities. Article 7 outlines States Parties obligations to take measures to ensure that children with disabilities are able to enjoy the same human rights and fundamental freedoms as other children, to consider their best interests, and to ensure that they are able to express their view. Article 23 of the CRPD establishes the right to family life and Article 24 promotes the right to education (7).   The CRC and the CRPD are mutually reinforcing and together provide a framework for a growing synergy between key human rights instruments. Furthermore, all initiatives intended to improve the lives of children, such as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) (14) apply equally and in full force to children with disabilities. Specific efforts must be made to reach and include these children if international commitments are to be achieved.     3. Early childhood development and disability Child development is a dynamic process through which children progress from dependency on caregivers in all areas of functioning during infancy, towards growing independence in the later childhood (primary school age), adolescence and adulthood periods (8,15). Skills emerge in a number of linked domains: sensory-motor, cognitive, communication and social-emotional (2,16,17). Development in each domain proceeds through a series of milestones or steps and typically involves mastering simple skills before more complex skills can be learned. It should be recognized that children play an active role in the development of their own skills (18) and their development is also influenced by interactions within their environment (19).  Box 1: Early Childhood Terminology Early Childhood: Early childhood spans the pre-natal period to eight years of age (1). It is the most intensive period of brain development throughout the lifespan and therefore is the most critical stage of human development. What happens before birth and in the first few years of life plays a vital role in health and social outcomes (20). While genetic factors play a role in shaping children’s development, evidence indicates that the environment has a major influence during early childhood (21).  Early Childhood Development: Early childhood development (ECD)\u0002 is a generic term that refers to a child’s cognitive, social, emotional and physical development. The same term is often used to describe a range of programmes which have the ultimate goal of improving young children’s capacity to develop and learn and which may occur at many different levels such as child, family and community, and across different sectors such as health, education, and social protection.     Developmental Delay: Developmental delay refers to children who experience significant variation in the achievement of expected milestones for their actual or adjusted age (8,15). Developmental delays are measured using validated developmental assessments (22) and may be mild, moderate or severe. Developmental delays are caused by poor birth outcomes, inadequate stimulation, malnutrition, chronic ill health and other organic problems, psychological and familial situations, or other environmental factors. While developmental delay may not be permanent, it can provide a basis for identifying children who may experience a disability (8). This further emphasizes the importance of early identification to commence timely interventions with family involvement, aimed at preventing delays, promoting emerging competencies and creating a more stimulating and protective environment. Early Childhood Intervention: Early childhood intervention (ECI) programmes are designed to support young children who are at risk of developmental delay, or young children who have been identified as having developmental delays or disabilities. ECI comprises a range of services and supports to ensure and enhance children’s personal development and resilience (23), strengthen family competencies, and promote the social inclusion of families and children (24). Examples include specialized services such as: medical; rehabilitation (e.g. therapy and assistive devices); family-focused support (e.g. training and counselling); social and psychological; and special education, along with service planning and coordination; assistance and support to access mainstream services such as preschool and child-care (e.g. referral). Services can be delivered through a variety of settings including health-care clinics, hospitals, early intervention centres, rehabilitation centres, community centres, homes and schools.  What factors affect child development? Children’s development is influenced by a wide range of biological and environmental factors, some of which protect and enhance their development while others compromise their developmental outcomes (15). Children who experience disability early in life can be disproportionately exposed to risk factors such as poverty; stigma and discrimination; poor caregiver interaction; institutionalization; violence, abuse and neglect; and limited access to programmes and services, all of which can have a significant effect on their survival and development (25,4,26,27). Poverty  Although disability can occur in any family, poverty and disability are strongly interlinked: poverty may increase the likelihood of disability and may also be a consequence of disability (5,28,29).  Pregnant women living in poverty may experience poor health, restricted diet, and exposure to toxins and environmental pollutants, all of which can have a direct effect on fetal development. Children living in poverty are more likely to experience developmental delays than children from higher socio-economic backgrounds because they are disproportionately exposed to a wide range of risks (15,16). These include: inadequate nutrition; poor sanitation and hygiene; exposure to infection and illness; lack of access to health care; inadequate housing or homelessness; inadequate child care; exposure to violence, neglect and abuse; increased maternal stress and depression; institutionalization; and inadequate stimulation (27,30). There is also evidence to suggest that children with disabilities and their families are more likely to experience economic and social disadvantage than those without disability (5). Disability can contribute to increased poverty at the household level as parents take time away from income-generating activities, siblings are taken out of school to care for a brother or sister with a disability, and families are required to meet the additional costs associated with disability, for example payments for health care and transportation (5).  Stigma and discrimination Children with disabilities are among the world’s most stigmatized and excluded children (31). Limited knowledge about disability and related negative attitudes can result in the marginalization of children with disabilities within their families, schools and communities (31). In cultures where guilt, shame and fear are associated with the birth of a child with a disability they are frequently hidden from view, ill-treated and excluded from activities that are crucial for their development (32). As a result of discrimination, children with disabilities may have poor health and education outcomes; they may have low self-esteem and limited interaction with others; and they may be at higher risk for violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation (5,31).  Some children with disabilities may be more vulnerable to discrimination and social exclusion than others due to multiple disadvantages arising from impairment, age, gender or social status (32,33). Other influential factors may include geographic location (living in rural, disperse areas), belonging to a minority language group and/or living in conflict zones or areas of natural disaster. For example girls with disabilities can be particularly at risk of being discriminated against (32) as well as children from poorer households and those from minority ethnic groups (10). Child-Parent/Caregiver interaction Stimulating home environments and relationships are vital for nurturing the growth, learning and development of children (15,16). The quality of child-caregiver interaction may be compromised when a child has a disability. Several studies have shown that there are differences in parent-child interaction when a child is disabled—mothers or caregivers of children with disabilities usually dominate interactions more than mothers or caregivers of  children without disabilities (34). Some children with disabilities have high support needs as a result of disabling health conditions and impairments and this dependency, in addition to other social and economic barriers, can place considerable stress on caregivers.  Caregivers may be isolated in communities that hold negative attitudes and beliefs towards disability. They may experience poverty and lack needed economic support; have limited access to information needed to provide appropriate care for their children; and have limited social supports (32). These factors can have a detrimental effect on the physical and mental health of mothers and fathers and their ability to respond to the child’s developmental needs. Research in high-income countries finds that rates of divorce and abandonment among parents of children with disabilities may be significantly higher than for parents of children without disabilities in the same communities (35). While research is lacking in LMICs, an emerging body of data shows similar issues of stress and needs for support and information (36). Siblings may also feel the effects, with parents having less time to devote to them as they struggle to meet the needs of their child with disability. However, an emphasis on barriers and problems risks overlooking the joy and satisfaction that can come from having a child with disability (37). Children with disabilities are usually loved and valued by their parents and siblings, and mothers in particular may develop many new skills and capacities through their caring roles. Considering that family settings are generally the first learning and protective environments for children, guidance and orientation are critical for families following the immediate identification of a developmental delay or disability in order to promote positive interactions. In addition to a child’s immediate family, his or her neighbourhood, community and societal structures also need to be considered (38). Institutionalization All children, including children with disabilities, have the right to be part of a family whether biological, adoptive or foster. In some countries, however, many children with disabilities continue to be placed in residential care institutions (39). For example in the Central and Eastern European Commonwealth of Independent States up to one third of all children living in residential care are classified as having a disability (39). Institutional environments are damaging to child development, with many children experiencing developmental delay and irreversible psychological damage due to a lack of consistent caregiver input, inadequate stimulation, lack of rehabilitation and poor nutrition (32,40,30). Furthermore, institutionalization isolates children from their families and communities and places them at increased risk of neglect, social isolation and abuse (32,41,42,43).   Violence, abuse, exploitation and neglect The first year of life is a particularly vulnerable period for children—they are not only at risk of infectious diseases and other health conditions, but also at risk of violence, abuse, exploitation and neglect. The United Nations Study on Violence Against Children highlights that in some OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries, infants under one year of age are at around three times the risk of homicide than children aged one to four, and at twice the risk of those aged five to 14 (44). However, the true extent of violence during the early childhood period is unknown given that it mainly occurs in private settings such as homes and institutional environments, and that social and cultural norms may influence the hiding and/or condoning of certain violent behaviours. Children with disabilities are more vulnerable to physical, sexual and psychological abuse and exploitation than non-disabled children. Social isolation, powerlessness and stigma faced by children with disabilities make them vulnerable to violence and exploitation in their own homes and in other environments such as care centres or institutions (32). Research shows that children with disabilities are three to four times more likely to experience violence than their non-disabled peers (45). Data for 15 countries showed that in seven countries parents of children with disabilities were significantly more likely to report hitting them (10).  Children with disabilities are at an increased risk of violence for a number of reasons including cultural prejudices and the increased demands that disability may place on their families (32,43). Children with disabilities are often perceived to be easy targets: powerlessness and social isolation may make it difficult for them to defend themselves and report abuse (32). Exposure to violence, neglect or abuse can lead to developmental delays and behaviour problems in childhood and later life (46,47). Humanitarian situations  There is a bidirectional link between humanitarian situations—such as conflict and natural disasters—and disability. While all children are vulnerable during humanitarian situations, children with disabilities are particularly at risk and disproportionately affected. Caregiver and child interaction during humanitarian situations can be worsened due to caregiver psychological stress and depression which can have a negative impact on children’s health and well-being (36).  In addition to the physical and emotional stress, children with disabilities may face other challenges. For example they may experience new impairments; they may lose essential medications and assistive devices; their impairments may prevent them from being able to walk long distances or stand in queues for food and water; where resources such as food or medicine are limited they may be considered as a lower priority than children without disabilities; and in situations in which they are separated from parents or extended family they may be at an increased risk of violence or abuse. Humanitarian situations can also result in a significant number of people experiencing disability due to injuries and a lack of access to needed medical care and rehabilitation (48). (See Box 2 below for further considerations in humanitarian situations.) Limited access to programmes and services Access to mainstream services such as health care and education plays a significant role in determining child health, development and inclusion. Children with disabilities often miss out on essential vaccinations and basic treatment for common childhood illness (32). Adequate health care, including nutrition, reduces child mortality rates and enables children to refocus their energy on mastering important developmental skills (46,49).  As children become older, access to early childhood education and transition to the first grades of primary school are also essential to establishing the foundation for continual learning and development (17,46). In comparison to other children, those with disabilities are less likely to start school and have lower rates of remaining in school (5,50). It is estimated that one third of all primary aged children who are not in school are children with a disability (3). Those in school are all too often excluded within the school setting, are not placed with peers in their own age group and receive poor-quality learning opportunities. Many children with disabilities also require access to additional learning opportunities and/or specialized services such as rehabilitation to maximize their development potential. In many countries programmes and services targeting young children are often inadequate to meet their developmental needs, and when available they are often costly, not inclusive and located in urban areas (51,32,22,52). While some countries have already adopted an approach to deliver services through a variety of settings at the community level, overall there is an insufficient number of service providers with sufficient knowledge of and skills in disability.  Why support the development of children with disabilities? Evidence-based research and multi-country experiences make a strong rationale for investing in ECD, especially for children at risk of developmental delay or with a disability.  Human rights rationale: Both the CRC and the CRPD state that all children with disabilities have the right to develop “to the maximum extent possible” (6,7). These instruments recognize the importance of focusing not only on the child’s health condition or impairment but also on the influence of the environment as the cause of underdevelopment and exclusion (12).  Economic rationale: Children with disabilities who receive good care and developmental opportunities during early childhood are more likely to become healthy and productive adults. This can potentially reduce the future costs of education, medical care and other social spending (53,54).  Scientific rationale: The first three years of a child’s life are a critical period. They are characterized by rapid development particularly of the brain and thus provide the essential building blocks for future growth, development and progress (2). If children with disabilities are to survive, flourish, learn, and be empowered and participate, attention to ECD is essential. Programmatic rationale: ECD programmes can lead to improved rates of survival, growth and development; and ensure later education programmes are more effective. Well-organized inclusive ECD programmes for young children with disabilities can provide parents with more time to engage in productive work and enable girls and boys with disabilities to attend school. Approaches combining centre-based programmes and parenting interventions, including home visiting programmes, may help parents and professionals to detect developmental delays early, improve children’s development, prevent abuse and neglect, and ensure school readiness (55,56).   4. How can we support the development of children with disabilities? Promoting development in young children with disabilities requires a twin-track approach (5). This approach recognizes that children with disabilities and their families have ordinary needs and must have access to mainstream programmes and services such as health care, child care and education, and also may need access to targeted services such as ECI. Building on existing health and education service structures for all children is essential, avoiding as much as possible the organization of separate and/or parallel services. A comprehensive approach is required for appropriate care and support including: early identification; assessment and early intervention planning; provision of services; and monitoring and evaluation. A life-cycle approach to programming provides a helpful framework to identify priority and sustainable interventions during the early childhood stage and to ensure a continuum of quality care, health services, protection and education as a child transitions from birth into and through the first grades of primary school. In addition, the life-cycle approach provides the foundation for organizing the roles and responsibilities of each sector in support of children and their families, aimed at guaranteeing a more holistic assistance plan while reducing potential duplication of services. A wide range of sectors should be involved in and share responsibility for identifying children with disabilities, providing ECD services and guaranteeing support for their families. There are currently many successful projects focusing on early development for children with disabilities throughout the world often in combination with good public health and Education for All (EFA) efforts (57,58,59,36).  Community-based rehabilitation (CBR) has also been one of the major approaches to addressing the needs of children with disabilities in LMICs. This approach empowers children and their families by bringing together communities and government and non-government health, education, vocational, social and other services (60). Further efforts should be made to ensure community-based approaches become an integral part of national health and education systems, policies and services.   Early identification of development delays and/or disabilities   Some health conditions associated with disability may be detected during pregnancy where there is access to prenatal screening, while other impairments may be identified during or after birth. Screening or surveillance of children’s development may take place during visits to general child health-care or ECD services; there may be targeted early identification procedures in place, such as screening for visual and hearing impairments in health-care or  education settings; and public health activities, such as immunization campaigns, may also provide opportunities for early identification. Some families may also become concerned about their child’s development if there are delays in the achievement of key developmental milestones such as sitting, walking or talking.  Unfortunately many children with disabilities in developing countries, particularly those with “mild to moderate “ disabilities, are not identified until they reach school age (61). Systems for early identification are required in order to facilitate timely access to services to support the development of children at significant risk for developmental delays, and to prevent potential issues, such as a loss of confidence in parenting skills (62).  It is important to ensure that early identification does not contribute to further discrimination and exclusion from mainstream services such as education. Ethical issues may also arise unless screening leads to: comprehensive assessment; the design of appropriate intervention plans; and timely and appropriate management and care (63,31). Decisions to undertake identification and screening should take into account the availability of services or resources to provide interventions as well as the effectiveness of these interventions (64). However, caution should be exercised against “inactivity” based on the assumption that ideal services are not fully available. Comprehensive tracking and follow-up systems can ensure that children who are identified through screening subsequently receive assessments and appropriate services (22).  Assessment and planning for early intervention Accurate assessment is an important starting point for better understanding and anticipating the needs of children with disabilities and their families. Assessment is not an end in itself, rather its goals are to obtain useful and accurate information about a child’s sensory-motor, cognitive, communication and social-emotional skills, and functioning and surrounding environment in order to assist parents, health-care providers, teachers and others to better understand, plan for and support the development and inclusion of a child with a disability. Assessment should be linked to intervention and should be an ongoing process of systematic observation and analysis. Parents are key partners in the early intervention assessment and planning process, and may require counselling and support on how to address the needs of their child following an assessment (see Family services below).  During the assessment process, a diagnosis may be made for some children while for others it may not be made until later or at all. Diagnosis depends on a number of factors including the nature and severity of the child’s problems as well as the availability of clinics or mobile units where diagnostic services are normally provided. Diagnosis can be clinically significant, particularly where interventions exist to treat or address health conditions, and can also be important from a social perspective, for example in terms of obtaining access to welfare benefits or services. Paradoxically, diagnosis can be beneficial for parents in providing certainty and validation and can help them seek out appropriate services and better advocate for their child. However, there are dangers in “labelling” children according to their diagnosis as it can lead to lower expectations and denial of needed services, and overshadow the child’s individuality and evolving capacities.   While identification and assessment of children with disabilities in high-income countries often involves teams of highly trained professionals, in LMICs such comprehensive expertise is often unavailable. In some countries, community-based workers are trained and supported by professionals where possible (such as through the use of outreach or mobile teams) to strengthen capacity and improve the quality of interventions. CBR programmes can also be key players in early detection and assessment efforts (60).   Service provision Mainstream service provision Inclusive health care Historically international development and global health communities have focused on preventing health conditions associated with disability (5). Some health conditions that arise during pregnancy and childbirth can be avoided by good preconception, prenatal and perinatal care. Public health initiatives play a major role in preventive efforts (65). Such initiatives include: childhood vaccinations; child health, nutrition and education campaigns; and decreasing the exposure of young children to diseases that may lead to impairments such as malaria and trachoma, as well as to childhood injury.  The priority for children who have disabilities is to ensure that they remain as healthy as possible so they can grow, thrive and develop. While children with disabilities often have specialized health-care needs related to their disability, they are also at risk of the same childhood illnesses as other children such as influenza, diarrhoea, and pneumonia for which they require access to mainstream health-care services. Children with disabilities are also at an increased risk of secondary conditions related to their disability. Children who are wheelchair users, for example, are vulnerable to pressure ulcers. Many of these conditions can be addressed by mainstream health-care services. Primary health care is a natural starting point for identifying and addressing the needs of children with disabilities (22,5), with appropriate referral for more specialized needs where required (5). Primary health-care workers can assist in the identification of children with disabilities, who are often hidden in their communities and denied access to health care, and support their inclusion in health-care activities such as immunizations (31). Where possible all centre-based health services should incorporate early identification, intervention and family support components as part of existing services. Food and nutrition programmes should also include children with disabilities and should be designed with consideration given to any specific digestive problems and nutritional requirements that may be associated with their disability.    Inclusive early childhood education Inclusive education is a process of strengthening the capacity of the education system to reach out to all learners—including those with disabilities—and can thus be understood as a key strategy to achieve EFA (66). As stated in Article 24 of the CRPD, children with disabilities should not be excluded from the general education system on the basis of disability and should have access to inclusive, quality and free primary and secondary education on an equal basis with others in the community in which they live (7).   Inclusive pre-school and early primary schooling offers children with disabilities a vital space in which to ensure optimal development by providing opportunities for child-focused learning, play, participation, peer interaction and the development of friendships. Children with disabilities are often denied early years of primary schooling, and when enrolled—due to a lack of inclusive approaches and rigid systems—they often fail, need to repeat and/or are encouraged to dropout during this critical developmental period. The CRPD and EFA initiatives promote inclusive education for all children, including those with disabilities (7) and call for the provision of assistance to ensure full and meaningful learning and participation. In many countries separate schools exist for children with certain types of impairments, for example schools for deaf or blind children. However, these schools usually accommodate a limited number of children, often lead to separation from the family at an early age, and fail to promote inclusion in the wider community. In some countries children with disabilities attend mainstream pre- and primary schools, however, they are segregated into special classrooms or resource centres which are staffed by teachers trained in special education (67,68,69,32). Education for children with disabilities should focus on inclusion in mainstream settings. While inclusion is consistent with the rights of children with disabilities and is generally more cost effective than special or separate schools, it cannot happen without appropriate levels of support. While additional investments are required, such as progressive national and local policy, trained staff, accessible facilities, flexible curricula and teaching methods, and educational resources, these investments will benefit all children.  For all inclusive early childhood education and learning interventions, positive attitudes and responses from and interactions with peers, teachers, school administrators, other school staff, parents and community members are critical (5,31,32). Assessing and monitoring ECD and school environments for promoting inclusion is an important part of guaranteeing appropriate educational opportunities for children with disabilities. Multisectoral approaches with effective coordinating mechanisms between such sectors as education, health and social welfare are required to ensure early identification efforts, promote holistic responses and link school-based learning with home and community interventions. Inclusive social services and child protection Parents/caregivers of children with disabilities, particularly mothers, need to have an adequate degree of economic security, access to resources and to basic services including health, nutrition and education, and protection from violence in order to be able to act on behalf of themselves and their children (1).  Children with disabilities and their family members require access to social services such as: child protection systems; support and assistance services; and social welfare services and benefits. Inclusive social protection\u0002 recognizes how the social dimensions of exclusion, including disability, can be barriers to security and essential social services. In this sense, social protection programmes may support families of children with disabilities allowing them to overcome financial and social barriers to access basic and essential services (70,71). Such programs include: the utilization of existing social transfers such as conditional cash transfers; anti-discriminatory legislation; and policy reform. It is important that conditional cash transfers do not exclude children with disabilities due to conditions that families cannot fulfil.   Guaranteeing the systematic support and protection for children with disabilities and their families requires on-going coordination between health, education, child protection, ECD and other social services. This should include the incorporation of specific early intervention actions as part of the regular delivery system as opposed to structuring separate or parallel services for children with disabilities.   Box 2: Supporting children with disabilities during humanitarian situations  Children with disabilities are particularly vulnerable during humanitarian situations such as armed conflict, natural disaster and famine. Article 11 of the CRPD highlights the importance of ensuring their protection and safety in all humanitarian action (7). Stakeholders across many different areas including: health; nutrition; water, sanitation and hygiene; emergency shelter and non-food items; education; and protection need to ensure the inclusion of children with disabilities in their activities during humanitarian situations and, where necessary, adopt targeted approaches to ensure all their needs are met.   Stakeholders can (60,72,73):    Prepare children with disabilities, their families and other relevant stakeholders for humanitarian situations by: identifying and registering children with disabilities and their families, noting where they live, their needs during humanitarian situations, and a plan for addressing these needs; including children with disabilities and their families in planning and preparedness activities which take place in their communities; ensuring that transport, emergency shelters, and alert and warning systems are accessible for children with different types of impairments, such as visual, hearing and mobility impairments;      providing training for people involved in preparedness and response so they are aware of the needs of children with disabilities and their families, and can address these needs.  Ensure emergency response includes children with disabilities and their families by: providing equal access to essential supplies, which may require specific strategies such as “fast track” queues and delivery of goods directly to children and their families;  organizing for replacement of lost or damaged assistive devices and providing new ones for children who have newly acquired injuries or impairments; ensuring that temporary shelters, water distribution points, and latrine and toilet facilities are physically accessible to children with disabilities and their families;  identifying child-friendly spaces and other child protection measures, and facilitate the inclusion of children with disabilities; including children with disabilities in education programmes.   Support children with disabilities and their families during the recovery phase by: providing access to appropriate health and rehabilitation services including assistive devices;  including accessibility considerations in the reconstruction phase to promote participation for children with disabilities. For example ensuring that schools and housing are accessible in the long-term.      Targeted service provision  Early childhood intervention (ECI) (see Box 1 above for definition) should be an integral part of existing health, education and social system actions for all children. The provision of intervention programmes as early as possible can result in positive outcomes for children with disabilities and their families and can address the multiple factors of exclusion (74,75). There is growing evidence that children who receive ECI and other services show gains in a wide range of skills, greatly enhancing their abilities to flourish when they begin formal education and thus justifying the greater costs that such targeted interventions might entail (60,5,36). In addition to enhancing children’s developmental competencies and minimizing secondary complications, ECI programmes can help to build effective support networks for parents, promoting confidence and competence. ECI programmes that coordinate services across different sectors, such as health, education, and social protection/support, are sustainable over time, and support children and families as they move from early childhood into successful primary school experiences are particularly desirable (36).   Therapy services, including assistive devices Therapy services aim to optimize a child’s development and ability to participate in family and community life by providing structured opportunities to practice skills appropriate to the child’s current developmental level (76). Service provision should include a combination of centre- and home-based interventions with the active involvement of parents and/or other family members. Where available, CBR programmes can assist in establishing a bridge between centre-based services and the home environment. Therapy interventions for young children include: therapeutic activities based around play and other activities; functional training to work on skills required for independence in everyday activities; education for parents to help them better understand their child’s disability and their role; prescription and provision of assistive devices\u0002 including user training; and modifications to the home and school environments. Interventions that allow the acquisition of even basic skills, such as helping a child with a disability learn to feed or dress himself or herself, can lead to a growing sense of independence and competency and reduce the burden on other family members. Family services Families are critical to the development and protection of their children and a close child-caregiver bond is important for both children with and without disabilities. Inclusion begins in the home environment during the early years and later broadens to school and community settings. Family services should aim to provide families with the knowledge, skills and support to meet and advocate for the needs and rights of their child in all settings (1). Service providers must work closely with families to design and implement interventions that are culturally appropriate and meet their needs (19,38,77). Following early identification and assessment, many parents/caregivers of children with disabilities will require information about their child’s disability and development progress, what steps they can and should take, and the resources available for support and treatment (4). Recognizing that formal assessment processes are often delayed or not available, the provision of information for parents is critical during the early stages of support and intervention. Information should be furnished in ways that educates parents and other family members and that promotes constructive dialogue within the family and community.  Fathers, siblings and other extended family members often play a significant role in caring for and supporting children with disabilities. Overlooking this potential support often places additional burdens on mothers. An approach which encourages father/male involvement and promotes competency building would significantly enhance families’ abilities to care for children with disabilities.  Group discussions, one-on-one listening, support groups for parents of children with similar disabilities and other potential interventions can provide opportunities to share experiences and encourage peer support and guidance. The use of stories that feature children with disabilities as protagonists is one way to demonstrate to all family members, including the child with a disability, that many capabilities are present and should be cultivated (39). Promoting appropriate activities that caregivers and children with disabilities can do together to improve developmental outcomes in children with disabilities is essential. Home visits by community workers combined with centre-based support can be an effective way to increase the confidence and competencies of parents and engage significant others in supporting the development of children with disabilities (78,32). Providing literacy and educational opportunities for adolescent girls and mothers can also have a direct impact on improving their care-giving competencies. Organizations of and for families with children with disabilities can be an important resource for parents and other family members, allowing them to learn from others in similar situations and providing them with relevant information and support. Links with disabled people’s organizations (DPOs) can: provide a network of support; provide information, guidance and advice; expand collective advocacy and public demand efforts; and connect parents and children with other people with disabilities who may serve as role models.   5. Conclusion and next steps: Implications for policy and programming The purpose of this document is to provide an overview of disability in early childhood and highlight the importance of providing opportunities during this period to ensure children with disabilities have the same opportunities as all children to reach their development potential and participate meaningfully in their home, school and community environments. The evidence presented underscores the urgent need to strengthen and/or scale-up early childhood development initiatives for young children with disabilities and their families. Coordinated and sustainable responses are required from a range of stakeholders at all levels to ensure that the rights and needs of young children with disabilities and their families are met. Critical are family members and those stakeholders who deal directly with young children to meet their health, education, protection and other needs. Essential are those who contribute to the development, implementation and monitoring of policies, budgets and services (e.g. governments, NGOs, professional organizations, media, private sector, and parent and disability advocacy organizations). While the CRPD provides a “renewed” starting point for recognizing the rights and needs of children with disabilities building on existing CRC, EFA and MDG initiatives, a sustained commitment is required to mobilize and support stakeholders to develop inclusive and targeted ECD programmes which are integrated into existing health-care and education systems. This includes within existing strategies, such as CBR, the Global Partnership for Education, Out-of-School Children Initiatives (OOSC), and other efforts to meet international goals, targets and commitments. This document is not an end in itself—it is an initial effort by UNICEF and WHO to stimulate discussion, planning and action on issues related to disability, early childhood development and early childhood intervention.  The following areas for action, which are aligned with the CRPD and draw on the recommendations in the World report on disability, provide a basis for further discussion, expert consultation, advocacy and mobilization efforts, and planning. Inclusion of children with disabilities in mainstream policies, systems and services which support and maximize their development potential. Review national policies in relevant sectors—health, education and social—to ensure they are aligned with international conventions and commitments (e.g. CRC, CRPD and MDGs) and inclusive of young children with disabilities. Analyse sector-wide strategies, programmes and budgets to determine whether they include concrete actions to support young children with disabilities and their families.  Develop, implement and monitor a comprehensive multisectoral national strategy and plan of action for young children with disabilities that addresses family support, community awareness and mobilization, capacity of human resources, coordination and service provision.  Advocate for and seek sustainable financial and technical support to address the service delivery gaps that have been identified.  Programmes and services which specifically target young children with disabilities and their families.   Assess the capacity of current programmes and services to accommodate the needs of children with disabilities and their families. Where gaps exist facilitate the integration of specialized services, such as ECI. Strengthen the capacity of parents’ associations and DPOs to provide care and support; undertake advocacy and public awareness initiatives; and participate in policy development, service design and programme monitoring. Involvement of children with disabilities and their families in all early childhood development activities including policy development, service design and programme monitoring.  Encourage the building of strong partnerships between parents and professionals to ensure ECD services relevant to children with disabilities are child/family focused. Provide assistance to strengthen the capacity of children with disabilities to participate in ways that they themselves find rewarding and meaningful while also promoting inclusive attitudes and behaviours of their peers. Capacity development of human resources across relevant sectors to address disability. Provide education and training on disability for relevant stakeholders. Training may cover the rights of children with disabilities, the need for both mainstream and targeted services, and strategies for the inclusion of children with disabilities and their families.  Public awareness and understanding about children with disabilities. Undertake advocacy at all levels to highlight the urgent need to include children with disabilities in ECD initiatives and provide targeted services. Utilize diverse communication channels, including mass and community media, traditional media, such as puppetry, poetry, song and storytelling, and interpersonal communication to eliminate stigma and prejudice and to promote positive attitudes towards children with disabilities and their families.   Data collection and research. Identify existing data collection systems for children and ensure they include provisions for the collection of information on children with disabilities, ensuring sex and age disaggregation.  Monitor and evaluate ECD efforts for children with disabilities. Collect evidence on what works—including examples of good practices—in promoting and supporting ECD for children with disabilities.

This implies moving away from targeting particular groups and looking at the underlying causes of exclusion and vulnerabilities these groups share: discrimination and stigma; traditional social norms preventing use of services; limited assets and visibility, etc (70).  \u0002Assistive devices that children with disabilities might require include mobility devices (e.g. crutches, wheelchairs, orthoses and prostheses); visual devices (e.g. white canes, eyeglasses, Braille systems and talking books); hearing devices (e.g. hearing aids); communication devices (e.g. communication boards and electronic speech output devices); cognitive devices (e.g. diaries, calendars and schedules); and daily living devices (e.g. adapted cutlery and cups, shower seats and commodes) (60).  \u0003  \u0004

  "articleText" : "Old Mutual share price: Wealth unit seen as blue-chip company\nDivision could end up in FTSE 100\nby Mary Morley Tuesday, 29 Mar 2016, 10:50 BST\nOld Mutualâ€™s (LON:OML) wealth unit could end up as a FTSE 100 company, The Telegraph has reported, quoting the divisionâ€™s chief executive. The comments come after news emerged over the weekend that the unit had attracted interest from some of Americaâ€™s biggest buyout funds, including Advent International and Bain Capital, the firms behind the recent float of Worldpay (LON:WPG).\nOld Mutualâ€™s share price has inched higher this morning, having added 0.31 percent to 192.50p as of 10:28 BST. The shares are slightly outperforming the FTSE 100 which currently stands 0.07 percent higher at 6,110.50 points. In the year-to-date, the shares have gained about eight percent, as compared with about a two-percent fall in the blue-chip index.\nPaul Feeney, who has led Old Mutual Wealth since 2012, told The Telegraph yesterday that the division could end up as a FTSE 100 company in its own right once it is carved out of Old Mutual. With the blue-chip financial services group having unveiled plans to split into four separate companies, the wealth arm expects a multi-billion-pound valuation.\nOld Mutualâ€™s wealth business includes Quilter Cheviot, an investment manager, and Intrinsic, a network of advisers. It also includes Old Mutual Global Investors, one of the best-known City asset managers.\nâ€œWeâ€™ve built a business here and now thatâ€™s probably a FTSE 100 company in its own right, if it went down that route,â€� Feeney pointed out.  â€œIâ€™m not saying it will go down that route, Iâ€™m just saying if it were.â€�\nWhile floating the business is an option, Old Mutual will reportedly consider bids for the unit before 2018 should a â€œknockout offerâ€� come along. Bain and Advent meanwhile are said to be considering joining forces to make a move on Old Mutual Wealth, while Cinven and Warburg Pincus have reportedly made a joint pre-emptive offer for the wealth division.\n",

  "articleText" : "Bidders Abandon Auction Of Tesco Data Unit\nMore\nA string of private equity firms have abandoned offers for Tesco's data arm after the retailer struck a deal with the unit that left prospective buyers concerned about financing.\nSky News understands that the interest of buyout groups including Apax Partners, CVC Capital Partners, Clayton Dubilier & Rice and TPG is either waning or that they are no longer in the frame to acquire Dunnhumby, which is now valued at well under £1bn - less than half original estimates.\nGeneral Atlantic Partners, which had been involved in a joint bid with WPP Group, the marketing services giant, is also said by people close to Tesco to have decided against pursuing its interest.\nIt is unclear whether Silver Lake Partners, a technology-focused investment firm, remains in the process, although it is said to have attached a number of conditions to any prospective offer.\nNews that the Dunnhumby auction has hit renewed turbulence comes the day after Tesco announced the sale of Homeplus , its business in South Korea, for well over £4bn.\nThe move will enable the UK's biggest retailer to slash its debt-pile and was hailed by Dave Lewis, its chief executive, as enabling it to make \"significant progress on our strategic priority of protecting and strengthening our balance sheet\".\nAnalysts have speculated that Tesco may decide to abort the Dunnhumby auction in the wake of the Korean sale.\nTesco recently struck a five-year agreement with the unit which manages its Clubcard loyalty scheme.\nThat arrangement will expire in 2020 meaning that a new owner faces having to secure another deal with the company which currently accounts for more than half of Dunnhumby's revenues.\nA number of private equity bidders withdrew on the basis of that deal, having struggled to secure acceptable borrowing terms from banks.\nThe buyout firms are said to have asked Tesco to consider offering a longer contract with Dunnhumby in an effort to make their bids viable.\nTesco took control of Dunnhumby in the early 2000s after it played a significant role in the grocer's emergence as the UK's dominant retailer.\nTesco, which is recovering from the most tumultuous year in its history, was initially expected to reap a £2bn windfall from the sale of the data arm.\nBut Sky News revealed earlier this year that the restructuring of the data analytics unit's relationship with Kroger, a US retailer, meant that the eventual price may be closer to one-third of that sum.\nTesco has also made what one bidder described as \"aggressive\" forecasts for Dunnhumby, suggesting that it could grow revenue to nearly £1bn and profit to almost £200m on the back of new client contracts by 2020.\nThe retailer is rebuilding in the wake of a £6.4bn annual loss for last year - one of the biggest in UK corporate history - and is the subject of inquiries by the Serious Fraud Office, Groceries Code Adjudicator and Financial Reporting Council.\nTesco and the private equity firms were either unavailable or declined to comment.\nReblog\n",

REUTERS/Thomas Peter\nBy Philip Blenkinsop and Foo Yun Chee | BRUSSELS\nBRUSSELS EU antitrust regulators have dropped Shell, BP, and Statoil from an investigation into suspected rigging of ethanol benchmarks, focusing instead on three producers of the biofuel.\nThe European Commission said on Monday it had opened a formal antitrust investigation into the actions of Spanish company Abengoa SA, Belgium's Alcogroup SA and Lantmännen ek för of Sweden.\nIn April, EU antitrust regulators raided several bioenthanol companies and at the same time stepped up a two-year investigation into biofuel price benchmarks. In 2013, it searched the offices of BP, Shell and Statoil too.\nBP, Shell, Statoil and price reporting agency Platts have been told they are not part of the investigation opened on Monday, two sources familiar with the matter said.\n\"The Commission's investigation focuses on behaviors in price benchmarks for the ethanol sector,\" the EU competition authority said in response to an email asking if crude oil and refined products were still being assessed.\n\"The Commission is currently not investigating further behaviors in price benchmarks for the crude oil sector.\"\nBP was not immediately available for comment, Shell declined to comment, and a spokeswoman for Norwegian state producer Statoil said there were no formal charges or accusations against the company.\nThe Commission said it was concerned that Abengoa, Alcogroup  and Lantmännen ek för may have colluded to manipulate ethanol benchmarks published by Platts.\nIt said this could include agreeing to submit or support bids to hike the benchmark and so drive up ethanol prices, leading to less use of biofuels as an alternative to fossil fuels, with negative consequences for consumers and the environment.\nPlatts said it had not been charged with any wrongdoing and was not an addressee of the European Commission's statement of objections in relation to the bioethanol pricing investigation.\nAlcogroup said: \"Alcodis and Alcogroup operate their activities in accordance with European law and therefore fully cooperate with the European Commission whilst ensuring their fundamental rights to be respected.\"\nLantmännen said it \"cooperates fully with the authority\". Abengoa was not immediately available for comment.\nIn a separate case, the Commission is also investigating several bioethanol producers on suspicion of taking part in a cartel following searches of offices. The sources said the oil majors are not involved in this case either.\nEthanol is made from biomass such as wheat, maize or sugar beet that is mainly added to gasoline and used as a biofuel for certain motor vehicles.\n(Reporting by Philip Blenkinsop; Addtional reporting by Dmitry Zhdannikov in London and Gwladys Fouche in Oslo; Editing by Susan Thomas)\nNext In Commodities\nIran optimistic on OPEC deal after meeting Algerian minister\nDUBAI Iran is optimistic OPEC can reach a deal on limiting oil supplies and plans to announce its own decision about any output curbs at the group's meeting next week, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on the ministry's official website SHANA.\nSaudi wants OPEC to solve own problems before meeting non-OPEC\nDUBAI/LONDON Top OPEC oil exporter Saudi Arabia has told the producer group it will not attend talks on Monday with non-OPEC producers to discuss limiting supply, OPEC sources said, as it wants to focus on having consensus within the organization first.\nShell CEO expects no valuation hit from climate accord\nAMSTERDAM Royal Dutch Shell expects to pump out all the fossil fuel reserves listed on its balance sheet, its chief executive said, dismissing concerns that production limits in the wake of the Paris climate accord could hit the energy giant's valuation.\nMORE FROM REUTERS\nFrom Around the Web Promoted by Taboola\nTrending Stories\n",

Patients typically live only nine to 12 months after initial diagnosis.\nIn a clinical trial tremelimumab failed to meet the goal of improving overall survival in hard-to-treat mesothelioma patients whose disease had already been treated unsuccessfully with standard drugs, AstraZeneca said on Monday.\nShares in the company fell 2.2 percent following the news.\n\"We are disappointed that tremelimumab monotherapy did not demonstrate a survival benefit in this patient population with no approved medicines beyond first-line treatment,\" said Robert Iannone, the company's head of immuno-oncology.\n\"However, we remain confident in tremelimumab’s clinical activity in combination.\"\nTremelimumab is also being tested in combination with another of AstraZeneca’s immune-boosting drugs called  durvalumab in multiple tumour types, including non-small cell lung cancer.\nAstraZeneca is relying heavily on new cancer drugs to drive long-term growth and replace sales lost from older products that are going off patent.\nIts biggest oncology bets are in the field of immunotherapy, or medicines that boost the body's natural immune system defences to fight cancerous cells.\nHowever, the British-based group is facing tough competition from various rivals, including Bristol-Myers Squibb, which has pulled ahead in the race to dominate the hot new area of cancer medicine.\n(Reporting by Ben Hirschler; Editing by Greg Mahlich)\nNext In Health News\n",

The FTSE 350 mining index sank to its lowest level since Dec. 2008.\nTraders cited a Investec note that raised doubts over Glencore's valuation if spot metal prices did not improve. The note pointed to high debt levels and a need for deeper restructuring.\n\"If major commodity prices remain at current levels, our analysis implies that, in the absence of substantial restructuring, nearly all the equity value of both Glencore and Anglo American could evaporate,\" analysts at Investec wrote.\nGlencore declined to comment.\nShares of Glencore were down 23 percent at 75.01 pence at 1028 GMT after falling as much as 27 percent to a record low of 70.66.

Profits earned by Chinese industrial companies declined at the sharpest rate in four years in August, according to official data.\nBrewin Dolphin analyst Nik Stanojevic said investors were likely pricing in a fresh drop for metals and commodities prices.\nNews that Glencore had sold a nickel project in Brazil to Horizonte Minerals for $8 million offered little respite, with Hobart Capital Markets' Justin Haque saying the price was a fraction of what Glencore had spent.\nTraders warned that the stock might might fall even further if more assets were put on the block.\n\"The market is concerned that there is going to be a fire-sale going on at Glencore,\" said Beaufort Securities' sales trader Basil Petrides.\n\"I don't think anybody knows where the floor is on the stock at the moment.\"  ($1 = 0.6571 pounds)   (Reporting by Lionel Laurent; Additional reporting by Olivia Kumwenda; Editing by)\nNext In Basic Materials\n",

The Financial Times reported the testimony in an article on its website dated Sunday.\n“We want to make it crystal clear that we will not tolerate improper business conduct of any sort and will take all necessary action to ensure compliance,” a spokesman for Rolls-Royce said in an e-mailed response today to the article.\nPetrobras, the state-run oil producer, is mired in Brazil’s biggest graft scandal, with accusations that company executives took bribes from a cartel of construction companies and shared the proceeds with politicians. The case is being investigated by Brazilian securities authorities, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and external lawyers hired by the company.\nRolls-Royce is already under investigation by the U.K. Serious Fraud Office for potential wrongdoing in business dealings in Asia. The investigation was made formal in December 2013 after the company in 2012 handed over details on its dealings in China and Indonesia that led to an investigation into bribery.\nIntermediary\nA plea bargain signed by former Petrobras manager Pedro Barusco was one of about 50 documents posted Feb. 5 on the court website. In testimony to police released with the plea bargain, in which he admits to crimes of corruption and money laundering, Barusco said he received at least $200,000 from the London-based engineering company and also took cash from SBM Offshore NV, the Dutch oil platform supplier, via an intermediary. Barusco reported to the head of Petrobras’ engineering division until 2010.\nSBM has agreed to pay The Netherlands’s prosecution office $240 million to settle a case of improper payments in Africa and Brazil, it said in a Nov. 12 statement.\nstatistics\n",

  "articleText" : "Five former traders on trial for conspiring to rig benchmark\nHarrison oversaw dollar trading for several years at bank\nShare on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp\nA senior Barclays Plc executive said he never saw or heard of any attempts to manipulate Libor at the British bank or any other firm when he was head of U.S. rates trading.\nHarry Harrison, now head of non-core assets at Barclays, told a London court Tuesday that any requests to change the benchmark rate would have been \"very inappropriate\" and he wasn’t aware of any attempts. He was responsible for dollar rates for a number of years starting in 2003.\nHarrison was speaking as a witness at the trial of former Barclays traders Jonathan Mathew, Stylianos Contogoulas, Jay Merchant, Alex Pabon and Ryan Reich. They are accused of conspiring to manipulate the dollar version of the London interbank offered rate from June 1, 2005, to Aug. 31, 2007. Lawyers for the defendants have alleged top executives including Harrison were aware of requests to change Libor to suit the bank’s positions and that the defendants were just following the standard practice.\nUnder cross-examination Merchant’s lawyer, Hugh Davies, said Harrison would put himself in \"very real professional and personal jeopardy\" if he said he knew of Libor-rigging. Harrison now reports directly to Barclays Chief Executive Officer Jes Staley. \nHarrison joined the bank in 1989 as a graduate trainee and received no formal Libor training, saying he gained on-the-job experience. Merchant and the other defendants would have had similar preparation for the job, Harrison said. He added that while Merchant was \"a promising trader,” he didn’t know him very well.\nWhen asked whether traders who sold swaps should have been allowed to discuss the bank’s positions with employees on the cash desk, who set Libor, Harrison said it was a \"gray area.\" The bank \"should’ve been more prescriptive\" about what conversations were acceptable, he said.\nDavies asked what value the cash desk knowing the bank’s swaps positions could have other than influencing Libor submissions. Harrison drew laughs from the defendants when he answered that the traders may just have wanted to share their profits and losses.\nThe case is the third criminal trial in the U.K. of bankers and brokers accused of rigging the rates underpinning trillions of dollars in securities and loans.\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

  "articleText" : "Renewed AB InBev bid for SABMiller ups stake in beer battle\nAssociated Press\nAny talk of a union between Budweiser and Miller — in fact, any talk of the creation of beer behemoth reaching all parts of the globe for that matter — should be put off for now as the owners of two of the world's most famous beers continue to haggle over the terms of a merger.\nEarlier Wednesday, Budweiser's Belgian-Brazilian owner Anheuser-Busch InBev sweetened its offer for SABMiller to more than 68 billion pounds ($104 billion) but the reply remained as bitter as the rejection of the two previous proposals.\nIt's just not enough.\n\"AB InBev is very substantially undervaluing SABMiller,\" said SABMiller chairman Jan du Plessis.\nThere was no outright rejection that a merger is possible so it remains possible that AB InBev could find a more genial response if it raises its offer further.\nWere an agreement to eventually emerge, the combined company would have 31 percent of the global beer market, dwarfing the next biggest player, Heineken, which has 9 percent of the market. As well as bringing together the classic U.S. favorites, the merger would also see AB InBev's Stella Artois and SABMiller's Grolsch in the same stable.\nAnd it would allow AB InBev to venture out more into the African and Australian markets where its might is yet to be felt like it is in Europe, North Africa and Asia.\nIn the event of a deal, the sheer size of the combined company is expected to push regulators to require the sale of some brands to ensure fair competition. That could include Miller in the United States.\nAB InBev CEO Carlos Brito said the combined company \"would build the first truly global beer company.\"\nEarlier, AB InBev increased its cash offer to 42.15 pounds ($64.35) per share. SABMiller quickly shot down the proposal, noting that it was only 15 pence higher than an informal 42-pound offer rejected by the board on Monday.\n\"AB InBev needs SABMiller but has made opportunistic and highly conditional proposals, elements of which have been deliberately designed to be unattractive to many of our shareholders,\" du Plessis, said in a statement.\nThe hustle to find the right price could still be some time off.\n\"The dance could continue for a while yet,\" said analyst Phil Carroll of Shore Capital.\nHe insisted though that SABMiller should take the bait at some stage.\n\"We believe this represents a good deal for SAB shareholders and ultimately we expect a deal to be agreed,\" he said.\nBeer makers are being pushed into consolidation by eroding market share and competition, particularly from trendy craft beers.\nSABMiller sold 324 million hectoliters (8.56 billion gallons) of lager, soft drinks and other alcoholic beverages in the year ended March 31. AB InBev sold 459 million hectoliters.\n",

REUTERS/Toby Melville\n1/2\nleft\nright\nAn employee stands near a window, with the company logo of installed on a building, at the headquarters of the Russian natural gas producer Gazprom in Moscow, February 24, 2015. REUTERS/Maxim Zmeyev\n2/2\nBy Denis Pinchuk and Katya Golubkova | MOSCOW\nMOSCOW Royal Dutch Shell's (RDSa.L) plans to build a strategic alliance with Russia's Gazprom (GAZP.MM) could be in jeopardy after the United States added one of Gazprom's biggest gas fields to its list of Russian sanctions on Friday.\nShell and Gazprom signed an agreement in June to develop a strategic alliance in the gas sector, ranging from upstream - exploration and production - to sales, including possible asset swaps.\nDevelopment of the Yuzhno-Kirinskoye field on the island of Sakhalin in the Pacific, a project known as Sakhalin-3, has been seen as central to that alliance as it would allow the two companies to expand their sole existing LNG venture, Sakhalin-2, located nearby.\nState-owned Gazprom was believed to be considering selling a stake in Sakhalin-3 to Shell, which confirmed only last week that it was interested in buying a share, possibly through an asset swap, according to Bloomberg. It may now have to rethink those plans.\nOn Friday the U.S. government said it was restricting exports, re-exports and transfers of technology and equipment to the Yuzhno-Kirinskoye field.\nShell, with considerable assets in the United States, would face consequences if it went against the sanction, as would other potential foreign investors.\nU.S. officials have repeatedly said that sanctions on Russia's energy sector - part of broader penalties imposed since 2014 over Moscow's involvement in Ukraine - would target new projects, not existing supplies as that could cause a spike in global energy prices.\n\"It is clear that this is a signal to Shell - don't go into new projects, deal with existing ones,\" an executive at a Russian energy company who works on projects in Sakhalin said, on condition of anonymity.\nLast year, Washington slapped sanctions on an Arctic project that state-owned Russian oil major Rosneft (ROSN.MM) planned to develop with U.S. oil major ExxonMobil (XOM.N), effectively forcing the two companies to suspend drilling despite the discovery of oil.\nSanctions have also affected Russian energy firms' ability to raise long-term funding and plans to develop shale and deep-water oil resources.\nHowever, this is the first time natural gas production has been targeted and Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said on Friday that new U.S. sanctions would further damage bilateral relations.\nSeveral sources at Gazprom said its lawyers were studying the impact of the U.S. decision. Executives at the company, which announced a 71 percent jump in first-quarter net profit on Monday, told a conference call it was too early to say how the decision could affect the project.\nSURGICAL STRIKE\nGazprom wants Sakhalin-3 to provide gas to expand capacity at Sakhalin-2 to as much as 15 million tonnes a year by the next decade from 10 million currently. Shell is the only foreign investor to have expressed interest so far.\nAlexander Kornilov, energy analyst at Alfa Bank in Moscow, said Gazprom would have to postpone development of Yuzhno-Kirinskoye and the planned expansion of Sakhalin-2 as both would require Western drilling and liquefaction technologies, which Russia is lacking.\n\"New sanctions is a surgical strike aimed at slowing down Gazprom's LNG projects in Asia. It will be impossible for Gazprom to develop Yuzhno-Kirinskoye without partners,\" he said citing difficult drilling conditions.\nSakhalin is one of the most important regions in Russia for foreign investment due to its offshore deposits. Yuzhno-Kirinskoye has reserves of 640 billion cubic metres - enough to supply Japan for five years - and 97 million tonnes of gas condensate, a by-product similar to oil.\nShell and Gazprom have invested more than $20 billion in Sakhalin-2, one of the world's largest liquefaction plants and Japan Mitsui (8031.T) and Mitsubishi Corp (8058.T) are also investors.\nShell said it was engaging with the relevant authorities and taking action to ensure it complies with all applicable sanctions or related measures.\n\"Shell remains committed to working in Russia and we value working with our Russian partners and colleagues,\" a Shell spokeswoman said.\n(Writing by Dmitry Zhdannikov; Editing by Susan Fenton)\nNext In Global Energy News\n",

  "articleText" : "AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo to jointly commercialise MOVANTIK in the US\nPUBLISHED 19 March 2015\nThursday, 19 March 2015\nAstraZeneca today announced a co-commercialisation agreement with Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. for MOVANTIK™ (naloxegol) in the US, in line with the Company’s strategy of delivering value through its own development and commercial capabilities as well as through external collaboration. MOVANTIK is a first-in-class once-daily oral peripherally-acting mu-opioid receptor antagonist (PAMORA) for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in adults with chronic non-cancer pain.\nMOVANTIK was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in September 2014. It was descheduled by the US Drug Enforcement Administration in January 2015 and is no longer labelled as a controlled substance. The launch of MOVANTIK in the US is planned for early April 2015.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Daiichi Sankyo Inc. will pay a $200 million up-front fee and subsequent sales-related payments of up to $625 million. AstraZeneca will be responsible for manufacturing, will book all sales and will make sales-related commission payments to Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. Both companies will be jointly responsible for commercial activities. AstraZeneca’s 2015 financial guidance, provided on 6 March 2015, is unaffected by today’s announcement.\nPaul Hudson, President, AstraZeneca US and Executive Vice President, North America, said: “We are delighted to collaborate with Daiichi Sankyo to expand our commercialisation efforts in the US in order to get this important medicine to the large number of patients suffering with opioid-induced constipation. Our agreement reflects our evolving business model by creating value from our portfolio through externalisation activity. Together, we will grow the potential of this important treatment, while we retain our significant interest in the long-term commercial success of MOVANTIK in our largest market.”\nKen Keller, President, US Commercial, Daiichi Sankyo, Inc., said: “We are proud to bring our proven primary care and specialty expertise to this collaboration with AstraZeneca. MOVANTIK represents an opportunity to help patients manage one of the most common conditions arising from widely used pain medications, as well as an opportunity to continue to build the Daiichi Sankyo US portfolio of medicines in this therapeutic area.”\nThe agreement is in line with AstraZeneca’s business model, which includes value creation from the strong science underpinning its pipeline and portfolio through externalisation activity. This approach aims to benefit patients by collaborating with subject matter experts that can help us to bring important treatments to market while delivering revenue.\n \nNOTES FOR EDITORS\nAbout MOVANTIK™ (naloxegol) tablets\nMOVANTIK (naloxegol) tablets is the first FDA approved once-daily oral PAMORA specifically designed for the treatment of OIC in adult patients with chronic non-cancer pain. In the Phase III clinical studies, MOVANTIK was administered as a once-daily tablet and was designed to block the binding of opioids to opioid receptors, in tissues such as the gastrointestinal tract.\nMOVENTIG® (naloxegol) also received Marketing Authorisation from the European Commission in December 2014 for the treatment of OIC in adult patients who have had an inadequate response to laxative(s).\nMOVANTIK/MOVENTIG is part of the exclusive worldwide license agreement announced in 2009 between AstraZeneca and Nektar Therapeutics. It was developed using Nektar’s oral small-molecule polymer conjugate technology.\nAbout OIC\nOIC is a condition caused by prescription opioid pain medicines. Millions of patients are treated with opioids each year. Opioids play an important role in chronic pain relief and work by binding to mu-receptors in the central nervous system, but they can also bind to mu-receptors in the bowel, which can result in patients suffering from OIC.

  "articleText" : "Tweet\nStocks were trading down on Wednesday, but likely that had nothing to do with the Ides of March. After a four-week rally, which followed about six weeks of serious selling, now the Dow and S&P 500 are fighting to break even in 2016 again. Investors have to feel caught in the up and down swings of the volatility pendulum. Do they return to the “buy every dip” mentality of 2011 to 2015, or do they start to sell into rallies again like in the first part of 2016?\n24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst upgrades, downgrades and initiations each morning from the top brokerage firms. Some of the daily analyst calls cover stocks to buy, and other reports cover stocks to sell or avoid. A goal in this review is to find new ideas and hidden value for our readers.\nThese are this Tuesday’s top analyst initiations, upgrades and downgrades seen from major research calls.\nAstraZeneca PLC (NYSE: AZN) was downgraded to Hold from Buy at Jefferies.

Shares were indicated down 2.3% at $29.35, against a 52-week trading range of $28.29 to $36.69.\n3D Systems Corp. (NYSE: DDD) may have seen shares rise 25% to $14.45 on Monday, but shares were indicated down almost 5% on Tuesday. 3D Systems was downgraded to Hold from Buy at Gabelli, and JPMorgan downgraded it to Underweight from Neutral. Goldman Sachs and Jefferies were already at Hold/Neutral but both downgraded their price targets. With shares at $13.75 in early trading, the consensus analyst price target was almost $12, and the 52-week range is $6.00 to $32.88.\nALSO READ: 7 Analyst Stocks Under $10 With Massive Upside Potential\nBarrick Gold Corp.

Californians are using significantly less water after leaders insisted that conservation is needed as the state’s drought persists.

(ICE) on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) March 1, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n1/2\nleft\nright\nA man walks past the London Stock Exchange in the City of London October 11, 2013. REUTERS/Stefan Wermuth\n2/2\nBy Noor Zainab Hussain , Esha Vaish and John McCrank\nNew York Stock Exchange owner ICE (ICE.N) said it may make a rival bid for London Stock Exchange (LSE.L), raising the prospect of a takeover battle with Deutsche Boerse (DB1Gn.DE) and lifting LSE shares to a record high on Tuesday.\nThe announcement by Intercontinental Exchange Inc is the latest development in a long string of mergers, bidding wars and failed deals among global exchanges.\nThe industry has been trying to consolidate for years amid weaker trading volumes and shrinking margins. Instead of stock trading, the exchanges have focused on more profitable businesses, such as derivatives trading and selling market data.\nBut regulatory concerns about the concentration of power in the hands of a few exchanges, along with nationalist wrangling, have hindered many cross-border deals.\nLSE Chief Executive Xavier Rolet has been one of the most vocal advocates of consolidation. In December he laid out his vision of global exchange consolidation, saying he expected three to five \"exchange powerhouses\" in North America, Europe and Asia.\nWhether ICE will follow through with a bid for LSE is not certain. The Atlanta-based exchange said it had not yet approached LSE and may not pursue a deal at all. Nonetheless, news of its interest pushed up share prices of exchanges across Europe.\nWhile Deutsche Boerse is interested in combining with LSE to create a full-service trading powerhouse, analysts said, ICE's interest likely relates to two of LSE's businesses: Clearing and market data. After acquiring NYSE in 2013, ICE kept the New York Stock Exchange and its mainly European-focused derivatives unit, Liffe, but sold off other substantial parts of NYSE's business.\nICE had attempted in 2010 to buy NYSE together with Nasdaq Inc (NDAQ.O). The two exchanges placed a bid to rival Deutsche Borse's, when the German exchange attempted to buy the Big Board. Regulatory concerns ultimately foiled both Deutsche Borse's and Nasdaq's attempts.\nThose concerns still carry relevance today.\nLSE and Deutsche Boerse are already walking a political tight-rope between London and Frankfurt as they hammer out terms of their agreed merger. Political and regulatory demands may be even more strenuous if a non-European exchange tries to buy LSE.\nCME Group (CME.O) is actively considering doing so, people familiar with the matter said. Analysts suggested that Euronext NV (ENX.PA) and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (0388.HK) may also be interested. All three declined to comment.\n\"It's going to force anybody that has been potentially looking at (LSE) to step up or go away,\" said Numis Securities analyst Jonathan Goslin.\nA RICHER OFFER?\nThe proposed tie-up of Deutsche Boerse and LSE, which was announced last week, would be an all-stock merger. It would give  Deutsche Boerse shareholders a 54.4 percent stake in the new company. However, rival bidders could force Deutsche Boerse to offer a bigger premium or bow out.\nDeutsche Boerse said it had seen ICE's statement but indicated it was not looking to alter its proposed offer, while LSE confirmed it had not received a proposal from ICE.     \"The company is continuing its merger talks with LSE with no change,\" Deutsche Boerse said in a statement.\nSources familiar with the proposed tie-up said the pair are betting that they stand a stronger chance of winning approval from European governments and regulators, than if a U.S. operator were involved.\n\"Deutsche Boerse and LSE are banking on political backing from Brussels, Berlin and probably also London for a 'European deal' that might support the planned EU capital markets union,\" one source said.\nThe source said Rolet still has faith in the Deutsche Boerse deal, even if a rival comes through with a richer offer, although analysts said an all-cash deal would be difficult to turn down.\n\"Our suspicion is that ICE or CME will derail the Deutsche-Boerse-LSE love affair only by offering cash,\" independent research firm AlphaValue said in a note to clients.\nShares of LSE, which had a market value of $13 billion at Monday's close, rose as much as 9 percent to 2,918 pence.\nICE shares were down about 3 percent at $231.26 in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while shares of CME Group Inc (CME.O) were up 1 percent at $92.38 on the Nasdaq.\nThe German company's shares ended regular trading at 76.87 euros, up 0.9 percent.\nICE must make an offer for LSE no later than March 29. Under British takeover rules, Deutsche Boerse must either make a formal offer or announce it will not do so by March 22, unless it gets an extension from the UK mergers regulator. Rolet plans to retire if LSE's planned merger with its German rival goes ahead.\n(Additional reporting by Jonathan Gould and Andreas Kroener in Frankfurt and Anjuli Davies in London; Writing by Rachel Armstrong and Lauren Tara LaCapra; Editing by Savio D'Souza, Alexander Smith and Steve Orlofsky)\nNext In Deals\n",

  "articleText" : "Retail and Consumer\nAldi to open more stores than Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons combined\nAldi to outgrow Tesco by almost ten times in 2015 as pressure on 'big four' is    laid bare\nAldi first opened in the UK in 1990 and now has more than 500 stores Photo: Bloomberg\nBy Graham Ruddick\n7:30PM GMT 21 Mar 2015\nAldi is planning to open more new shops in the UK this year than Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons combined according to comprehensive new supermarket research that lays bare the dramatic changes in the industry.\nThe German discounter, which celebrates its 25th anniversary of opening in the UK this year, plans to open 1.02m sq ft of shop space in 2015, the equivalent of roughly 60 shops.\nThis compares to just 450,000 sq ft for Sainsbury’s, 220,000 sq ft for Morrisons, and is almost ten times more than the 170,000 sq ft Tesco intends to open.\nThe findings from IPD, the commercial property industry’s leading research body, and Colliers, the property agent, show how the grocery industry has been turned on its head by the rise of the discounters and a slump in sales for the “big four”, which includes Asda as well as Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons.\nThe “big four” have expanded rapidly over the last two decades but have been forced to scrap new store openings to shore up their battered balance sheets.\nRelated Articles\nSainsbury's boss claims there are 'green shoots' of recovery for supermarkets\n17 Mar 2015\nTesco announced earlier this year that it was scrapping 49 stores as new chief executive Dave Lewis responded to a fall in sales and the discovery of a £263m blackhole in retailer’s accounts. The search shows that the amount of space Tesco will open this year is down 76pc on 2014.\nIn contrast, the German discounter Aldi, which now has more than 500 shops in the UK, is ramping up its expansion plans as it grows market share. After Aldi, Marks & Spencer has the most ambitious store opening plans and intends to open 600,000 sq ft of space. Asda plans to open 550,000 sq ft while Aldi’s rival Lidl wants to open 340,000 sq ft, double the amount of Tesco.\nOverall, 3.9m sq ft of space is due to be added to Britain’s grocery industry this year. However, in a shift from recent patterns, just 29pc of this will be traditional supermarkets. Instead, 54pc will be small supermarkets of between 3,000 sq ft and 15,000 sq ft, which is Aldi’s favoured size, while 17pc will be convenience stores such as Tesco Express and Sainsbury’s Local.\nJames Watson, head of UK investment at Colliers, said the grocery industry has “rebooted itself” as the biggest chains look to fightback against a change in consumer habits towards smaller and more frequent shops rather than one weekly trip to an out-of-town supermarket.\nHe added: For all operators, it is the consumer’s increasing predilection for online delivery topped up by convenience basket shops leading to the demise of the super profits generated by the traditional trolley shop that is at the heart of their problems. Grocery delivery is not an area where the operators can make profits – yet.”\nThe report also highlights that Britain’s pension funds could take a hit from the pressure on the industry because they own supermarkets across the UK.\nIn 2014, 86pc of all the supermarkets bought were by UK institutions such as pension funds, which is in line with the historical average.\nThe value of supermarkets is now under pressure as the profitability of the industry falls and demand to develop new sites slows.\nThe value of supermarkets bought and sold in the UK dropped by 27pc year-on-year during 2014 to £1.3bn. The report said there was £500m of deals in the second quarter of the year but then the “depth of problems facing the operators became increasingly obvious”.\nMr Watson the industry was likely to become split between prime and secondary supermarkets, with stores in the busy locations still likely to perform robustly.\nHe said: “Operator difficulties are being offset by an improving economic situation and a more constrained supply of new supermarket assets.\n“However, there is now a more clearly defined primary and secondary market for assets.\n“The secondary market has more pain to come.”\n \n",

  "articleText" : "Published: Jan 19, 2016 4:32 a.m. ET\nShare\nBy\nSaabiraChaudhuri\nLONDON-- Unilever PLC reported little progress in its margarine business and confirmed that the division's chief executive had resigned, sparking further speculation that the slow-growing business could eventually be sold.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that Sean Gogarty had stepped down to pursue other opportunities, according to the contents of an internal memo. He has been replaced by Nicolas Liabeuf, formerly senior vice president of marketing operations.\nA person familiar with Mr. Gogarty's departure said it was motivated by incompatible views on how the spreads business should be run, after Unilever's foods head Antoine de Saint-Affrique left to become CEO of Barry Callebaut and was replaced by Amanda Sourry.\nMr. Gogarty's initial brief was to \"return the business to growth and keep it within Unilever,\" but that changed after Ms. Sourry became president of Unilever's food division in October, said this person. Unilever declined to comment.\nThe developments come as Unilever reported strong results for 2015, with sales buoyed by currency gains, while the company logged strong growth in its home-care and refreshments arms.\nThe maker of Magnum ice cream, Dove soap and Axe deodorant posted a net profit of EUR4.91 billion ($5.34 billion), compared with EUR5.17 billion last year, a period when it was buoyed by gains from divestitures. Core operating profit climbed 12% to EUR7.9 billion. Revenue of EUR53.3 billion was up 10%, or 3.9% at constant currencies. Underlying sales growth--which strips out the impact of acquisitions, disposals and currency movements--was 4.1%, compared with 2.9% in the same period last year.\nSales in emerging markets grew 7.1%, up from the 5.7% growth the company reported last year, as Unilever was helped by strong price growth.\nIn its earnings report, Unilever said sales in the Baking, Cooking and Spreads unit \"continued to decline as we were not able to stem the sustained market contraction in developed countries.\" The company in December 2014 announced the unit's creation, with Mr. Polman at the time naming Mr. Gogarty as its CEO with some fanfare, calling him Unilever's \"best marketer\" to a room packed with analysts, according to a person present for the announcement.\nUnilever has in the past insisted that it won't sell spreads, which gives it a consistent cash flow and makes up roughly 5% of company sales but about 8% of profit, according to Société Générale. However as Unilever rolls out more aggressive cost-cutting measures across the business, grows margins in home-care, and strengthens its personal care arm, analysts have posited that its reliance on cash from the spreads unit is diminishing.\nOn Tuesday, Exane BNP Paribas analyst Jeff Stent said Mr. Gogarty leaving Unilever amounted to \"inevitably increasing speculation on an overall exit.\"\nIn an interview, Unilever's chief financial officer, Graeme Pitkethly, said Unilever has been trying to \"expand out into other more on-trend parts of the category beyond simply margarine.\"\n\"We look at everything through a lens of value,\" Mr. Pitkethly said when asked by the Journal if Unilever would sell or strike a joint venture for the spreads unit, valued at EUR7 billion, according to Société Générale. \"We aren't going to simply offload a problem if it's declining on the top line, we are driven by value,\" he said.\nMargarine has always been a part of Unilever's story. The company was founded in 1929 through the merger of a British soap maker Lever Brothers and a Dutch margarine company that began making the plant-derived spread in 1872.\nBut the world's largest margarine maker--which owns brands such as Flora and Bertolli--faces an uphill climb to bring spreads back to growth.\nAfter decades of being held up as the culprit for clogged arteries and expanding waistlines, butter has been enjoying a comeback as consumers have come to see it as being more wholesome and natural than margarine. Last year, unit sales of butter and butter blends in the U.S. climbed 4.2% from a year earlier while sales of margarine plummeted 8.9%, according to data from Chicago-based research firm IRI.\nIn October, McDonald's Corp. said switching from using margarine to butter on its Egg McMuffins in the U.S. pushed sales of the breakfast sandwich up by a double-digit percentage. \"Customers appreciated the change,\" McDonald's CEO Stephen Easterbrook said last fall.\nMeanwhile, butter prices last year fell below those of margarine for the first time, according to Unilever CEO Paul Polman, after Russia banned dairy imports from Europe.\nMr. Polman has likened separating spreads to putting a sick child in a separate room to his siblings with special care until he recuperates. The company is working on pushing into baking ingredients, liquid margarine for cooking and blends of vegetable oil and butter and is also trying to cut the unit's costs.\n\"It only needs modest growth for the economics to work but if it continues to decline, we don't see much of a future,\" said Mr. Ackerman earlier this month. \"Effectively, it has been given a warning and it will be interesting to see if it is given the red card.\"\nWrite to Saabira Chaudhuri at saabira.chaudhuri@wsj.com\nMore from MarketWatch\n",

REUTERS/Phil Noble\nBy Bill Berkrot and Ben Hirschler\nU.S. regulators have approved a new dose of AstraZeneca's blood thinner Brilinta for longer-term use in patients with a history of heart attacks, boosting prospects for a drug the company thinks will eventually sell $3.5 billion a year.\nThe green light from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), announced late on Thursday, could theoretically more than double the number of people eligible for the medicine.\nIn practice, while the new label will certainly help, long-duration therapy may be reserved for patients with particularly high heart risks and little danger of bleeding complications, said Deutsche Bank analyst Richard Parkes.\nThe FDA approved Brilinta at a new 60 milligram (mg) dose to be taken with aspirin beyond a year after a heart attack. The drug, used to prevent blood clots that can cause heart attacks, strokes and deaths, had previously been approved at a higher dose just for use during the 12 months after a heart attack.\nThe FDA move comes a week after European heart experts endorsed the potential use of Brilinta and similar blood clot preventers beyond a year.\nThe expanded approval suggests patients could be taking Brilinta for considerably longer than now and the FDA did not set any limit on the duration of treatment.\nTom Keith-Roach, vice president for Brilinta at AstraZeneca, told Reuters the FDA endorsement would shift thinking among heart doctors and expand the market, as clinical practice moves increasingly towards longer-term drug use.\nOnly about a quarter of acute coronary patients in the United States who start on Brilinta, or rival blood-thinners, remain on treatment for 12 months. In Europe, more patients do receive therapy for a year but very few are treated beyond that.\n\"We're not going to see fireworks but this will support really strong and consistent growth over time. I've got a nice straight line that goes from our current reported sales to my $3.5 billion,\" Keith-Roach said.\nSelling more Brilinta is a high priority for the British drugmaker. During a takeover battle with Pfizer last year, it forecast annual sales of the drug could reach $3.5 billion by 2023.\nConsensus forecasts currently point to sales of $1.7 billion by 2020, according to Thomson Reuters Cortellis, suggesting considerable upside if AstraZeneca hits its target. Brilinta sales rose 23 percent to $144 million in the second quarter.\nUnder the new FDA recommendations, patients with a history of heart attacks can be treated with 60 mg of Brilinta twice daily along with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 to 100 mg, beyond the first year's treatment.\nAstraZeneca also has clinical trial programs under way to expand the use of Brilinta in stroke, peripheral arterial disease and diabetes.\n(Reporting by Bill Berkrot in New York, Samantha Kareen Nair in Bengaluru and Ben Hirschler in London; editing by Bernard Orr and David Clarke)\nNext In Health News\n",

  "articleText" : "Tuesday 12 January 2016 07:58 BST\nRevival plan: Morrisons boss David Potts Toby Melville/Reuters\nThe City has piled into unfancied supermarket Morrisons and retailer Debenhams as the duo confounded their critics with much stronger-than-expected Christmas trading.\nBoth saw shares surge today: Morrisons was up 10% and Debenhams 16% as they caught the Square Mile off-guard with upbeat results.\nAnalysts had feared the worst for Morrisons — relegated from the FTSE 100 last year after a bitter price war — and department store chain Debenhams after downbeat updates from Next, Marks & Spencer and Sports Direct.\nBut the supermarket put in a rise in sales for the first time in four years, as chief executive David Potts said he cut back on in-store promotions, offered fewer multi-buy deals and improved pricing.\nIt left same-store sales up 0.2% in the nine weeks to January 3 — although nearly 1% of the boost to sales on last year came from the online operation and did not take into consideration the sell off last year of the convenience-store business.\nDiscounters Aldi and Lidl declared Christmas trading winners\nPotts said: “We are seeing customers coming in asking where things are and that’s a clue they haven’t been there before. I witnessed that up and down the country.\n“Some of our deals and marketing did attract more customers. We haven’t set out yet to welcome back customers to Morrisons… We need to make sure we’re right first. New customers are always willing to give stores a try.”\nBut despite the improvements, there was bad news for 680 staff as Potts said a further seven stores would close, in addition to the 20 shut last year.\nStaff were told on Tuesday, and Potts said no more shops are planned for closure.\n\"We are seeing customers coming in asking where things are and that’s a clue they haven’t been there before.\"\nMorrisons boss David Potts\nThe branches to be closed were not revealed until staff had been informed, but Potts said they were all smaller stores of around 15,000 square feet.\nInvestors were pleased with the performance and sent shares up nearly 10%, rising 15.2p to 167.5p, although analysts pointed out that the Kantar market data showed Morrisons down 2.6% once closures and the convenience-store sell off is considered.\nOver at Debenhams, outgoing chief executive Michael Sharp defied the market by revealing sales in the 19 weeks to January 9 rose 3.5% as he said the department store managed to avoid the pitfalls of the warm weather which affected rivals Marks & Spencer and Next.\nHe explained that the company focused more heavily on gift sales than in previous years, moving away from clothing. The retailer now sells fewer clothes than other goods.\nDebenhams sales rose 3.5% (Picture: PA)\nSharp added: “Over the course of the past few years we said we’d plan our sales more prudently with lower stock levels… That was about trying to make the business more flexible and we had less clothing stock than last year.”\nIt meant the retailer was not lumbered with too much warm clothing during one of the mildest Decembers on record. \nInvestors were impressed, with shares up 16%, or 10.55p to 76.55p.\nMore about:\n",

REUTERS/Edgar Su\nSINGAPORE/MUMBAI Singapore's DBS Group Holdings (DBSM.SI) and Julius Baer BAER.VX are seen as potential bidders for Barclays (BARC.L) Asian private wealth business, valued at about $600 million (402.6 million pounds), sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.\nBarclays is weighing the sale, the sources said, even though a formal sale process had not begun.\nDBS sees wealth management as a core growth business and is keen to expand in that area, having bought Societe Generale's (SOGN.PA) Asian private bank for $220 million last year.\nWhile Barclays declined to say whether a sale was on the cards, several smaller Asian private banks that have struggled to generate enough revenue to pay expensive bankers and cover rising regulatory costs have been sold recently.\n\"We are working through cellular analysis which examines what we do best and where. This has caused some speculation as we have numerous business lines and geographies,\" a Barclays spokesman in Singapore said.\nDBS and Julius Baer were the two most likely bidders for the business if it came up for sale, two people familiar with the matter said. The sources declined to be identified as the discussions were confidential.\n\"Barclays is doing soft marketing for the sale of the unit,\" said a source with knowledge of the matter, adding Swiss banks were also interested.\nDBS' head of wealth management, Tan Su Shan, told Reuters in June that DBS was aiming for a 40 percent jump in its private banking assets to $100 billion in less than three years.\nBarclays managed $36 billion in private banking assets in Asia as of 2014, according to a survey by industry publication Private Banker International, ranking it 14th in Asia. DBS was ranked eighth.\nUBS UBSN.VX and Citigroup (C.N) were the top private banks in Asia, according to the survey, followed by Credit Suisse CSGN.VX which has also made Asia its priority region for business growth.\nAsia has seen a spate of deals in the private banking sector since the financial crisis, notably in 2009 when ING offloaded its Asian private bank to Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp (OCBC.SI) for $1.5 billion.\nOther deals included Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) selling its Asia and other non-U.S. private banking business to Julius Baer, and smaller deals include HSBC (HSBA.L) selling its Japan private bank to Credit Suisse CGSN.VX.\nStandard Chartered (STAN.L) said this week it had hired former Barclays banker Didier von Daeniken as its global head of private banking and wealth management.\n(Reporting by Saeed Azhar in SINGAPORE, and Sumeet Chatterjee in MUMBAI; Additional reporting by Steve Slater in London; Editing by Denny Thomas and Stephen Coates)\nNext In Business News\n",

  "articleText" : "The Canada Car Buying Guide  / Insurance\nAccording to Ontario Law , every driver must have car insurance on the vehicle that they drive, and every insurance policy must include the following:\nThird-Party Liability Coverage with a $200,000 minimum in case someone else is killed or injured or their property is damaged as a result of a car accident you are in\nStatutory Accident Benefits Coverage provides you with benefits if you are injured in an accident even if you were at fault\nDirect Compensation & Property Damage Coverage for any damage to your vehicle and possessions inside it if you are in an accident and someone else was at fault\nUninsured Automobile Coverage for you and your family if you are injured or killed by a vehicle that is uninsured or flees the scene before their identity can be determined\nAny insurance you get must come through a company or broker who is licensed to sell car insurance by the Government of Ontario. There are three types of contacts to help you get insured:\nBroker - sells you the best insurance rate from a number of different companies they represent\nAgent - usually sells insurance only for a single company.\nDirect writer - represents a company that sells insurance directly to drivers.\nThese different options allow you as the driver to shop around to different companies and contacts so you can find the best insurance rate.\nCost of Car Insurance in Ontario\nThe cost ofcar insurance in Ontario depends on several factors. In general, the main things taken into account when setting someone's policy cost include:\nDriving experience - how long you've been driving in Canada (your record in other countries is not counted)\nDriving history - how many accidents or speeding tickets you have\nAge - the older you are the lower your rates in general\nGender - women typically get lower rates than men\nLocation - there are more accidents in crowded cities like Toronto than in smaller towns\nVehicle - cars that are cheaper and have higher safety ratings do not cost as much to insure\nVehicle usage - the more you drive the higher chance you get into an accident\nWinter tires - a new Ontario law allows for drivers to get an insurance discount for using winter tires during the snowy season.\nOntario has the highest average insurance rates in Canada out of any other province. This is due to a greater concern for insurance fraud compared to any other province, but also due to the nature of insurance laws. Ontario mandates better standard coverage and accident benefit laws, so the extra cost at least has extra benefits as well.\nDid You Know? The average car insurance policy in Ontario costs $1,920 per year, compared to the Canadian average of $1,320. Of all the provinces in the country, Ontario has the highest average insurance cost.\nCar Insurance for New Drivers\nFor new drivers who are young and are still working their way through Ontario's Graduated Licensing program, insurance policies and costs will work differently than it will once they get their full G License.\nFirst, their rates will be higher. This is because inexperienced and statistically at a greater risk of being in an accident. Each time they upgrade to a higher license level, their rates will be lowered. So the rates from when they have a G1 will drop when they get a G2, and will drop again when they get a full G.\nHowever, the higher rates are can be mitigated if they do not have their own car. If they only drive their parents' cars then they will not be insured as the main. Not being the main driver means they are not using the vehicle as much, and this lowers their rates.\nTemporary Car Insurance\nStandard car insurance policies in Ontario usually run for at least one year, but there could be unique circumstances where someone needs shorter term car insurance-someone traveling to the province for an extended business trip, or someone visiting family for a few months, someone who has a lapse in their insurance, and so on.\nSome insurance companies do provide short term insurance options, but it won't be easy to find information about it on their websites. You will normally have to call several companies and speak to a few representatives before you can find someone who can give you the information you need.\nTemporary or short term car insurance should never be used instead of regular insurance. It is considerably more expensive over the same length of time as standard insurance policies.\nDid You Know? The average annual insurance payment in Ontario for men is $1,968 and $1,836 for women. This is not because women statistically have been less likely to be in a car accident, but when they are in one it is less costly than accidents that men are in.\nDo Car Insurance Companies Share Information?\nCanada has privacy laws that protect most of your personal information, so insurance companies cannot share your information with each other a lot of the time.\nHowever, there are some other federal and provincial laws that allow for exceptions. The biggest exception is Bill S-4, or the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act . One of the implications for insurance companies is that it they can share personal information without consent if it reasonably allows them to discover and prevent fraud.\nSuch cases would be relatively rare, and will not impact most people. Insurance companies would not share information they have about you as a client with other companies when it pertains to your previous rates and coverage.\nWhen Will My Insurance Rates Be Reduced?\nThere are a few changes that can happen that will help reduce your insurance rates:\nGetting a higher driver's license level or completing a safe driving course\nBeing older while also keeping a clean driving record\nChanging your policy's deductible or level of coverage to something cheaper\nMoving to a safer area, somewhere with more secure parking, or out of a bigger city to a smaller town\nOld accidents and tickets falling off of your record\nShopping around at another company who offers cheaper rates\nSome of these changes can happen without you doing anything, and if you want your rate to improve as a result you should call your insurance company to see if they will lower it. If not, take a quick look around at other companies and see if they'll offer you a better rate.\nDid You Know? Fines for being caught driving a car without a valid car insurance policy range between $5,000 and $50,000, and you can also have your license suspended or car impounded. If you cause a car accident without proper insurance, you have to pay legal and medical costs.\nWhat if I Get Into a Car Accident?\nIf you are in a car accident , your rates will not necessarily be negatively affected. Here's a quick outline of the various general situations and what they might mean for you:\nYou were the sole driver in the accident - you are automatically at fault\nYou were not at fault - your rates are not affected\nYou were at fault - it stays on your record for 6 to 10 years and your rates might be affected\nIf you were found to be at fault but you have been with the insurance company long enough and have a clean driving record, they might forgive the rate increase so it is only a small amount. Any increases to your rates usually only happen once the next year in your policy kicks in.\nHow to Choose a Car Insurance Company\nThe best way to choose an insurance company is to shop around and see who can offer the best rates for the type of coverage you want:\nOnline comparison sites - enter your information and they show you comparative rates from numerous companies\nInsurance brokers - they represent multiple companies and they can make the best offer from them for you\nCall them yourself - if you want to be thorough look up the big companies and call them yourself to see what offer they can make\nIt might take a bit of time and work, but in the end you can save yourself a lot of money. Remember that there are so many factors that affect how much you pay, and so much that constantly changes, that you can do this again every so often and again find a better deal if you're willing to put in the work. Changing companies does not negatively affect your rates.\nDid You Know? New reforms to Ontario insurance law took effect on June 1st 2016 that will reduce the average costs for basic policies. The new policies will also include less coverage, but you will have more choice to pick what extra coverage you want.\nSummary\nCar insurance can be as complicated as just buying the car itself, but with some tips, understanding of the process, and effort on your part to shop around you can get great insurance coverage at a good deal than you might otherwise. Good luck!\nYou might also be interested in these guides:\n",

Witty himself will play a role in finding his successor.\nWitty, a 31-year company veteran who has been CEO since 2008, has been under fire from some investors in the past three years as sales and profits have flagged. His reputation was further tarnished by a damaging bribery scandal in China.\nThere have been calls from a minority of shareholders, including respected UK fund manager Neil Woodford, for a break-up of the group, with critics arguing its pharmaceuticals and consumer health units would do better as standalone businesses.\nWitty has conceded that spinning off the company's large consumer healthcare division could be an option but he has argued this is not something that should happen in the short term.\nOver the coming year, Witty believes, GSK will demonstrate a return to growth and the consumer division will be showing improved profitability. GSK aims to double profit margins at the consumer unit, which is currently being overhauled following a complex asset swap with Novartis.\nGSK declined to comment on the plans to find a successor to Witty, which were first reported by the Sunday Times. The newspaper said headhunter Egon Zehnder had been asked to draw up a list of potential candidates, both internal and external.\nThe executive search firm already works on a retained basis for GSK as a consultant on senior management appointments.\nLikely internal candidates could include GSK's global pharmaceuticals head Abbas Hussain and leader of the consumer division Emma Walmsley, as well as finance chief Simon Dingemans, a former Goldman Sachs banker.\nExternally, GSK might try to snare a senior figure from a rival drugmaker, such as Novartis' respected pharma head David Epstein, or else look beyond the drugs sector to an executive with broader experience in consumer products.\nHampton was appointed chairman at GSK's annual meeting in May 2015 and he said at the time he hoped Witty would remain in charge for \"a good while to come\", while adding there was no hard and fast rule about how long chief executives should serve.

The index is about 7 percent below a record high of 7,122.74 points reached in late April.\nTop faller was Intertek, down 3.7 percent after it was downgraded to \"underperform\" by Jefferies, citing its exposure to oil and gas industries that have been hit by a fall in prices.\n\"We are concerned that the depth and the duration of the oil and gas downgrades will be a negative surprise, particularly with regards to margins from price pressure,\" analysts at Jefferies said in a note.\nBabcock, British Land, Burberry, Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling and Royal Mail  traded without entitlement to their latest dividend payout, which trimmed a further 1.7 points off the FTSE 100, by Reuters calculations.\n(editing by John Stonestreet)\n",

REUTERS/Stefan Wermuth\nLONDON Morrisons (MRW.L), Britain's fourth-largest grocer, is in advanced talks to sell its convenience stores to investment firm Greybull Capital as new chief executive David Potts seeks to focus the business on its traditional supermarket estate.\nA source familiar with the matter told Reuters Greybull was working with a team of industry executives to take over about 150 stores that trade as M local and generate annual sales of about 300 million pounds ($470 million).\nThe possible deal was first reported in the Sunday Telegraph newspaper.\nBoth Greybull and Morrison declined to comment.\nMorrisons was a late entrant into Britain's fast-growing convenience sector, opening its first stores in 2011. Though it has since grown at pace, its convenience presence is tiny compared with bigger rivals Tesco (TSCO.L) and Sainsbury (SBRY.L) and has little bearing on its profit performance.\nA ramp-up under former CEO Dalton Philips failed to deliver the level of trading it had anticipated.\nMorrisons said in March it would close 23 M local stores during its 2015-16 financial year and would significantly slow new openings. It would also review the M local project and approach to site selection.\nPotts, who joined as CEO in March, has said he did not think M local was working in its current form and believed many stores were not in the right location.\nHe has said his priority is improving the performance of Morrisons' more than 500 core supermarkets and making the group simpler, leaner and more cost conscious.\nPotts is due to give update on his plans on Sept. 10, when the company is also due to publish first-half results.\nMorrisons shares were down 1.3 percent at 176 pence by 1020 GMT, valuing the business at 4.1 billion pounds.\n(Reporting by Freya Berry and James Davey; Editing by David Holmes)\nNext In Business News\n",

  "articleText" : "Business News | Mon Feb 15, 2016 | 10:58am EST\nHSBC keeps headquarters in London, rejects move to Hong Kong\nBy Rachel Armstrong and Lisa Jucca | LONDON/HONG KONG\nLONDON/HONG KONG Banking group HSBC Holdings (HSBA.L) has decided to keep its headquarters in Britain, rejecting the option of shifting its center of gravity back to main profit-generating hub Hong Kong after a 10-month review.\nThe decision by HSBC's board, which Europe's biggest bank said was unanimous, gives a boost to London's status as a global financial center, under threat since the financial crisis of 2007-09 from tougher regulation and rising costs.\nYet Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver immediately warned that the bank could not stick with the status quo were Britain to vote in favor of leaving the European Union in a promised referendum, saying it would consider moving around 1,000 employees from London to Paris.\nSome investors had encouraged HSBC to consider moving its HQ from Britain, partly because of a tax on banks' global balance sheets brought in after the financial crisis which had cost it $1.1 billion in 2014.\nBut following extensive lobbying by the banking industry, British finance minister George Osborne said in July he would halve the levy and, crucially for HSBC, no longer apply it to the overseas assets of British banks, part of efforts to help to keep Britain an attractive place for banks.\nThe bank denied using the threat of moving to force the British government to rein in the tax.\n\"We had no negotiation with the government,\" HSBC Chairman Douglas Flint told BBC radio on Monday. \"The government was very well aware of our view ... but there certainly was no pressure put on, or no negotiation\".\nThe waiver on applying the levy to HSBC's overseas assets will only come fully into effect in 2021 at the earliest, leaving the bank exposed to shifting political winds in Britain in the interim, said Investec analyst Ian Gordon in a research note, who nonetheless kept a \"buy\" rating on its shares.\nAsked if the government had caved in to threats by the banks, a spokeswoman for Prime Minister David Cameron said Osborne's budget last year had set out that the levy was introduced to raise revenue and stabilize bank balance sheets. \"It served its purpose, it worked but it risks doing harm if left unchanged, he (Osborne) said that clearly last summer.”\nA Reuters analysis showed that moving to Hong Kong might have actually increased the bank's tax burden.\nLESS AGGRESSIVE\n\"Arguably, a more benign approach in the UK to the regulation of banks, and a less aggressive tone by politicians, also played an important part in the decision,\" said Guy de Blonay, a fund manager at Jupiter Asset Management which holds shares in HSBC.\n\"The bank can now turn its attention to succession planning, likely to revolve around its Chairman Douglas Flint initially (2017), and then CEO Stuart Gulliver (2018)\".\nThe decision to stay in London comes after a tumultuous period for European banks, whose shares have tumbled on fears of a global economic slowdown and the impact on earnings from a prolonged period of low or negative interest rates.\nHSBC shares are down more than 30 percent from last April when the group began its headquarters review, hit by China's flagging economic growth and market turmoil.\nFor Hong Kong, the chance of luring back HSBC, short for Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp, to its birthplace and to the heart of its Asian growth strategy has been lost for now.\n\"London is one of the world's leading international financial centers and home to a large pool of highly skilled, international talent,\" HSBC said in a statement. \"It remains therefore ideally positioned to be the home base for a global financial institution such as HSBC.\"\nAnalysts estimated the cost of moving out of London at between $1.5 billion and $2.5 billion, a hefty bill to swallow unless HSBC was able to achieve clear tax and regulatory advantages.\nHong Kong, where HSBC was founded about 150 years ago and where it employs more than 20,000, was considered the strongest relocation option as it accounts for 46 percent of HSBC's pretax profit.\nBut gyrations in Chinese markets coupled with concerns about China's growing influence over Hong Kong had helped make it more likely the bank would stick to London.\nHSBC said it remained committed to its Asia \"Pivot\" strategy, under which it plans to invest more into China's Pearl River Delta north of Hong Kong which already accounts for half of HSBC's China revenue.\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority, which had earlier said it would welcome an HSBC move to Hong Kong, said it respected the board's decision to maintain the status quo.\n(Additional reporting by Denny Thomas in Hong Kong and Kate Holton, Simon Jessop, Kylie MacLellan and Lawrence White in London;

  "articleText" : "Shell share price: Standard Life announce position against BG acquisition\nProposed terms are â€œvalue destructiveâ€� for shareholders, SL says\nby Veselin Valchev Monday, 11 Jan 2016, 12:53 GMT\nStandard Life, one of UKâ€™s leading investment funds and a top shareholder in both Royal Dutch Shell Plc (LON:RDSA) and BG Group, has become the first major shareholder to openly oppose the proposed Â£34 billion takeover of fellow energy giant BG Group.\nThe investment fund, which holds 0.4 percent of Shellâ€™s A shares and 1.7 percent of the B shares making it Shellâ€™s 11th top shareholder, said on Friday that the risk of further oil price declines and risks connected to BG's Brazilian assets, which are tied with embattled and indebted state-owned giant Petrobras, make the deal undesirable.\n\"We have concluded that the proposed terms of the acquisition of BG are value destructive for Shell shareholders,\" said David Cumming, head of equities at Standard Life Investments. â€œThis view is based on the downside risks to Shellâ€™s oil price assumptions plus the tax and operational risks surrounding BGâ€™s Brazilian asset base. Consequently we shall vote against the deal.â€�\nStandard Life, which is also BG Groupâ€™s 16th largest shareholder with a 1.3 percent stake, has held meetings with Shell executives in a bid to convince management to renegotiate the terms.\nShell did not comment on Standard Lifeâ€™s statement, but a spokesman said on Friday, following a call for the dealâ€™s endorsement by an influential adviser, that the company believes it has â€œthe broad base of shareholder support we need for the deal to completeâ€�.\nâ€œCompelling strategic rationaleâ€�\nInstitutional Shareholder Services (ISS), a key shareholder advisory firm, said in a report released on Friday that the recent slump in oil prices does not take away from the â€œstrategic opportunity of a transaction whose benefits will be realized over decadesâ€�.\n\"There is credible evidence... that the price Shell is paying is reasonable even considering the decline in oil prices and oil stocks since the deal was announced,â€� ISS said in a report released today. \"Given the compelling strategic rationale, and the significant positive economics to be realized within a relatively short time frame, support for the transaction is warranted.\"\nFellow proxy adviser Glass Lewis, which advises 12 of Shell's top 50 shareholders, also advised investors to back the merger late on Friday, saying the deal \"could lead to significantly improved financial results and the creation of substantial shareholder value\".\nShell and BGâ€™s shareholders are set to vote on the merger on January 27 and 28, respectively, with Shell required to secure backing from 50 percent of its shareholders, while BG must win approval from 75 percent of its investors. The merger is likely to become effective February 15, Shell has said.\nShellâ€™s share price closed the first week of 2016 with a 10 percent loss, which compares with a 10 percent drop in oil prices and a five-percent fall for the FTSE 100. Shell closed 2015 some 30 percent in the red.\n",

Australia and South Africa have already given their blessing.\nThe Belgium-based maker of Budweiser, Corona and Stella Artois wants to strengthen its presence in Latin America and Africa to offset weaker markets such as the United States where craft brews and cocktails are gaining popularity at the expense of beers.\nNext In Commodities\nShell CEO expects no valuation hit from climate accord\nAMSTERDAM Royal Dutch Shell expects to pump out all the fossil fuel reserves listed on its balance sheet, its chief executive said, dismissing concerns that production limits in the wake of the Paris climate accord could hit the energy giant's valuation.\n",

That cemented expectations the company will be forced to cut its dividend for the first time in more than 25 years.\nThe STOXX Europe 600 Basic Resources index was down 6.3 percent, with Rio Tinto, Glencore and Antofagasta also among top fallers.\nAll four stocks also suffered from target price cuts by Japanese bank Nomura. Copper has hit a new 6-1/2 year low this week and was set for its second straight weekly loss.\nThe oil and gas sector was also under pressure, down 3.8 percent. Brent and U.S. crude both fell below $30 a barrel, as markets braced for more oil supply from Iran.\n\"Stocks are being driven by oil, and given that the Iranian sanctions are due to be lifted, that's causing even more nervousness about this glut of oil that we have,\" said Zeg Choudhry, managing director of LONTRAD.\nConcerns over commodities and Chinese growth have marked a rocky start to the year for global markets. Chinese shares  closed at their lowest level since December 2014, rocked again by falling oil.\nThe FTSEurofirst 300 ended down 2.8 percent at 1,297.1 points, making its third straight weekly loss. It fell 6.7 percent last week when China allowed its currency to devalue.\nEnrico Vaccari, fund manager at Italy's Consultinvest, said investors were testing central banks to see whether they had ammunition left to prop up markets and the economy.\n\"There is a symbolic poker match between the market and central banks. I don't think China and oil are the real problem here,\" he said \"The market is trying to force the hand of central banks in the hope they unleash more stimulus. So far there has been no answer but at some point it will arrive.\"\nThe European Central Bank holds its next policy meeting on Thursday.\nAmong other fallers, Brenntag dropped 5.9 percent after the chemicals firm was cut to \"hold\" from \"buy\" by Deutsche Bank.\nThe top riser was Syngenta, up 1.8 percent, following a Bloomberg report saying its board had voted in favour of pursuing advanced takeover talks with ChemChina.\nH&M was up 0.6 percent after it posted a rise in sales in December which beat forecasts.\nToday's European research round-up    (Editing by Toby Chopra)\nNext In Market News\n",

  "articleText" : "BG Group ships first LNG from QCLNG Train 2 in Australia\n13 July 2015\nBG Group plc (LSE: BG.L), a world leader in exploration and LNG, today announces it has started up and loaded its first LNG from the second production train at the Queensland Curtis LNG (QCLNG) facility in Australia. The first LNG from Train 2 set sail on the Maran Gas Posidonia.\nAt plateau production, expected mid-2016, both trains at QCLNG will be producing enough LNG to load ten vessels per month combined, exporting around eight million tonnes per year. Since production from the first train commenced in December 2014, 27 cargoes have been shipped.\n \nBG Group began commercial operations in May 2015, when control of Train 1 formally transferred to QGC, BG Group's Australian subsidiary, from the constructor Bechtel Australia. Train 2 commercial operations will begin once a similar commissioning process has been completed.\nHelge Lund, Chief Executive of BG Group, commented:\n\"The start-up of QCLNG's second LNG train is another important operational milestone delivered in line with our plan. The completion of our upstream infrastructure and the two LNG trains are achievements of which BG Group, particularly our team in Australia, can be proud. We have already shipped more than 1.5 million tonnes of LNG from Queensland, and Train 2 will add significant further volumes and flexibility to our LNG shipping and marketing portfolio.\"\nNotes to Editors:\nThe Curtis Island facility has more than 32,000 tonnes of steel, 139,000 cubic metres of concrete, 1950 kilometres of electrical cable and 200 kilometres of piping.\nAbout BG Group:\nBG Group plc (LSE: BG.L) is a world leader in natural gas, with a broad portfolio of business interests focused on exploration and production and liquefied natural gas. Active in more than 20 countries on five continents, BG Group combines a deep understanding of gas markets with a proven track record in finding and commercialising reserves.\nBG Group trades in the US in the form of ADRs (American Depositary Receipts) on the OTCQX International Premier market under the symbol (OTCQX:BRGYY).\nFor further information visit:   www.bg-group.com\nContact:\n",

These are accounts aimed specifically at traders following the Islamic faith, where trading is considered “Halal” (translated as “allowed” or “permissible”). These accounts are actually technically called “swap-free” accounts. They allow no swap or rollover interest on overnight positions, as this is against the Islamic faith. If you’d like a swap-free account, simply open a trading account and speak with the XM support team for more details on the application process.\nXM state that they value trading efficiency and want to provide their customer with a fantastic user experience.

We haven’t even mentioned their minimum deposit amount of $5(!), the lowest we’ve seen in online Forex. There’s a lot to shout about when it comes to XM.\nLicensing Jurisdictions\nXM holds trading licenses in numerous territories via its parent company Trading Point Holdings Ltd. These include licensing by CySEC (Cyprus), MiFID (EU), FCA (UK), BaFin (Germany), CNMV (Spain), AFM (Netherlands), FI (Sweden), FIN (Finland), PSZÁF (Hungary), CONSOB (Italy), ACP (France), KNF (Poland) and the ASIC (Australia).

The extensive licensing allows them to bank with British banking institution, Barclays Bank PLC. This allows XM to further reassure all clients of the safety of their funds, which are segregated from company funds. Clients of XM are offered additional protection through the Investor Compensation Fund in the case of company insolvency. It’s worth mentioning that XM also use an automated system for monitoring funds and transactions to ensure no negative balances on trading accounts, protecting its clients from losses that exceed their investments.\nTrading Platform and Features\nMost Forex brokers provide an industry-leading platform such as MetaTrader 4 and combine this with a good mobile app. XM offer NINE platforms, five of which are dedicated to desktop computers and four that are dedicated to mobile traders. They truly do not waste any opportunity to live up to the claim of “Valuing Trading Efficiency” and cater for traders of all levels and requirements.\nThese platforms are each described in brief detail below.\nXM MT4 Terminal – This is XM’s version of the industry-leading MetaTrader 4 platform. It is highly configurable and perfectly suited to both expert and novice traders alike. It offers a live news feed and an extensive technical analysis capabilities. The MT4 platform also incorporates One Click Trading alongside their manual trading feature, and even allows you to setup EAs to automatically place trades for you. In fact, there are a number of add-ons and applications that will help you trade and improve your strategies. Trade Forex, Futures and CFDs with no requotes and no rejections on this platform.\nXM Mac MT4 – This is a mac compatible version of the highly popular MT4 platform. This version of the platform includes all of the features and functionality described above, but allows traders to use the platform on Apple Computers WITHOUT the need to run a parallel Windows desktop or Windows emulator.\nXM MT4 MultiTerminal – The MultiTerminal platform is primarily designed for money managers or traders who use multiple accounts and execute multiple order types simultaneously. Many of the features of MT4 are available, but EAs are not allowed as the terminal is intended for managing multiple accounts only. MultiTerminal doesn’t provide tech analysis either, but it does offer financial news and system alerts in real-time, along with several execution models designed to meet the requirements of those who need to manage multiple accounts.\nXM MAM – As mentioned earlier, XM seem to be the “One Broker for All” as they provide a huge number of solutions. If you are a fund or portfolio manager, or you are interested in managing multiple accounts WITH the complete features of MT4, this is the platform for you. Unlike MT4 MultiTerminal, XM MAM allows Automated Trading with EAs and provide the Charts and technical analysis you’d expect from MT4. There is so much more to this platform as it even allows multiple account holders to manage multiple MT4 trading accounts through one main account. If this sounds suited to your requirements, we recommend you speak with the support team to fully understand the features and functionality available here.\nXM WebTrader 4 – This is XM’s online trading platform.

It comes highly recommended.\nXM iPad Trader – XM brings MetaTrader 4 to all iPad users with their iPad Trader platform. It provides access to your MT4 account and presents real-time interactive charts with zoom and scroll functionality. It also provides real-time quotes of financial instruments, a full set of trading tools and a complete trading history, ensuring that traders can analyse their progress accurately.

Their mobile platforms offer outstanding trading flexibility by bringing you a scaled down version of MetaTrader 4 to your fingertips.

The percentage then changes to 20% until you reach a maximum bonus amount of $5,000.\nThere are numerous ways to fund your trading account AT XM. In fact, we believe that they offer one of the most extensive lists of deposit options out there. They accept all major Credit and Debit Cards (including Diners Club and Union Pay), and offer multiple bank transfer options. The range of online payment solutions offered includes Neteller, WebMoney, Skrill, CashU and iDeal.

We recommend that you provide the necessary documentation and verify your account on registration to avoid delays with withdrawals. All withdrawals requests will be processing within 24hrs, but all withdrawal requests submitted will be instantly reflected in your trading account.\nWhy Trade at XM.com?\nThere are several reasons why we think you should trade with XM. They only require a minimum deposit of $5, and have numerous speedy deposit and withdrawal methods. They offer a huge leverage of 888:1 for qualifying traders, and this is one of the highest in the Forex industry.

This year it has also divested certain non-core products to boost its profit line.\nHyperkalaemia is typically associated with chronic kidney disease and chronic heart failure, AstraZeneca said, adding that peak sales of the company's ZS-9 potassium-binding compound, which is under review by the FDA, were forecast to exceed $1 billion.\nAstra said the deal would not impact its financial guidance for 2015.

The firm has focused its efforts on appealing to smartphone and tablet users, who run over 400,000 Auto Trader searches daily.\nAuto Trader shares rose as much as 16.5 percent from the offer price of 235 pence to almost 274 pence, and at 1515 GMT were up 15 percent.\nThe company raised about 437 million pounds in the offer, while Apax reaped proceeds of 926 million pounds from a sale of 59 percent of the company.\nIncluding an over-allotment option for up to 15 percent of shares, Apax would be left with a holding of around 25 percent.  The size of the offering is larger than usual, and far above Britain's listing requirements of 25 percent.\n\"They took the opportunity to reduce their overhang. They could have priced higher but they chose instead to do the bigger deal,\" said a source close to the deal, referring to the unusually large proportion of shares that the fund is selling.\nTAKEOVER APPROACH SPURNED\nApax acquired 49.9 percent of Auto Trader from the Guardian Media Group in 2007 in a deal that valued the business at 1.35 billion pounds. It subsequently bought the rest of the company in 2014 for 619 million pounds.\nThe listing follows an approach by U.S. private equity firm Hellman & Friedman earlier this year with a potential 2 billion-pound takeover offer.\nAnalysts raised questions about next steps for the brand, which focuses chiefly on the UK and Ireland. It generates 250 million pounds of revenue a year and employs 830 people.\n\"It's an online business that really does only one thing. Competitors such as eBay and Gumtree could impact that,\" said Mike Butler, analyst at data provider Eagle Alpha, adding that Auto Trader is seen by some car dealerships as expensive.\n\"One option would be a bolt-on business in the UK, like an insurance arm, to build the brand here. A new territory is a bigger undertaking,\" Butler said.\nMoney raised from IPOs is down 16 percent globally as of March 12 this year compared with the same period of 2014, according to Thomson Reuters data, although the number of offerings is on a par.\nLast year saw a spate of private equity-backed offerings, including British retailers Poundland and Pets at Home , as funds took advantage of surging stock markets to exit investments made before the crisis.\nBank of America Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank  are joint global co-ordinators and joint bookrunners, with J.P.

  "articleText" : "Environment | Tue Jun 30, 2015 | 6:54pm EDT\nU.S. walrus protections hit Shell's Arctic drilling plan\nA member of Greenpeace is chained to a gas pump at a Shell gas station during a protest in Zurich, June 30, 2015. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann\nBy Timothy Gardner | WASHINGTON\nWASHINGTON The Obama administration dealt a setback to Royal Dutch Shell's Arctic oil exploration plans on Tuesday, saying established walrus and polar bear protections prevent the company from drilling with two rigs simultaneously at close range, as it had planned.\nThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service issued Shell a permit which emphasized that under 2013 federal wildlife protections, companies must maintain a 15-mile (24-km) buffer between two rigs drilling simultaneously.\nThe rule is meant to protect populations of animals sensitive to sounds and activities of drilling. Walruses have been known to plunge off rocks into the sea during drilling, putting some at risk. The animals are already at risk from reduced habitat due to global warming.\nDrilling with only one rig at a time would slow Shell's drilling progress, but by how much was unclear. Shell, which has invested about $7 billion in its Arctic exploration over several years, is evaluating the permit and \"will continue to pursue\" its drilling plan, spokesman Curtis Smith said. The company hopes to begin producing oil there in 10 or 15 years.\n\"Our goal is to safely accomplish as much work as we can before the end of open water season.\" The return of ice in late September ends the drilling season.\nIn Shell's 2015 Arctic drilling plan, no two of its wells are more than 15 miles apart. Two of the wells it had been planning to drill in the Chukchi Sea off Alaska are about nine miles (14 km) apart.\nThe move by the federal government came the same day that Shell began to send the Noble Discoverer, the second of two drilling rigs, up to Alaska from the Seattle area, for drilling starting in late July. Shell was hoping to return to Arctic drilling for the first time since its mishap-plagued 2012 season.\nLast week, green groups had said the wildlife rules could hamper Shell's drilling season. On Tuesday, an environmentalist blasted the company's blueprint for the Arctic that the Interior Department conditionally approved in May, pending permits including Fish and Wildlife's.\n\"Shell's whole drilling plan is premised on a plan that is unlawful from the start,\" said Erik Grafe, a lawyer at Earthjustice in Anchorage.\nShell can still drill with one rig at a time this summer, if it gets a few more permits, the Interior Department said.\n(Additional reporting by Eric M.

The shares dropped as the utility reported a loss on interest rate swaps.\nRevenue rose 2.5 percent to 1.8 billion pounds ($2.8 billion). The Coventry, England-based company reported higher earnings were curbed by a 133.5 million-pound loss on financial instruments, where interest rate swap losses more than offset an exchange rate gain on loans.\nThe stock traded 0.6 percent lower at 2,169 pence in London at 3:25 p.m. on a day the FTSE was 0.6 percent higher as “substantial” financial instrument losses, hard for analysts to forecast, “spurred today’s share-price weakness,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Elchin Mammadov said by e-mail.\nUnderlying pretax profit advanced to 300.4 million pounds for the year ended March from 276.1 million pounds a year earlier. Severn Trent, which spent 547.4 million pounds last year upgrading water-treatment works, cleaning sewers and reducing sewer flooding and pollution events, is planning to invest 3.3 billion pounds in improvements through 2020.\nThe company said in March it planned to invest 190 million pounds in renewable energy to generate half its electricity needs within five years. Severn Trent will build its first solar plants this year and is installing facilities that turn food waste into power to shield itself from fluctuating energy prices. Power bills for the year slid 1.4 million pounds.\n‘Economic Case’\n“Energy is one of our highest costs and energy is volatile so we’re trying to move ourselves into a less volatile position on energy costs,” Chief Executive Officer Liv Garfield said by phone. “There is a good economic case for spending on energy.”\nLarger rival United Utilities Group Plc said Thursday it plans to spend 100 million pounds on clean energy by 2020 to cut electricity bills. It’s aiming to supply 35 percent of its power from waste-to-energy generation, wind and solar.\nPennon Group Plc, the third-largest publicly traded water company in the U.K., earlier this week reported profit rose 0.9 percent on higher earnings at its Viridor waste-to-power unit.\nSevern Trent on Friday proposed a 5.6 percent rise in the total dividend for the year of 84.9 pence a share.\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

If they do decide to leave the UK, the plan will be put to shareholders to make the final decision.\nMartin Walker at Invesco Perpetual said the bank is right to consider leaving - as long as it can find a better alternative location.\n\"It is the right question to ask at this stage in the regulatory cycle. The pendulum has swung too far in terms of punitive regulation of banks, and where international banks have an option, then they are duty bound to their shareholders to explore those options,\" said Mr Walker.\n\"With any move to any new jurisdiction you would clearly need to weigh up the benefits versus the potential idiosyncrasies of the new jurisdiction. It is a balancing act, but clearly if HSBC felt that it was beneficial to be domiciled somewhere else, then that would be a move I would support.\"\nDouglas Flint, HSBC chairman\nStandard Life's Mr Cumming said UK banking regulations have rightly been tightened up, but have now gone too far and so HSBC should leave.\n“Obviously we need stress tests, and banks should have prudent capital,” Mr Cumming said. But regulators had engaged in a “never ending process” of continually bludgeoning banks as they approach the last target set for them, he said.\nThey are continually “moving the goalposts”, Mr Cumming said. If HSBC did decide to move, “I think a lot of shareholders … would be supportive of that, given the current situation in terms of regulation”, he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.\nStandard Life is the 12th biggest shareholder in HSBC, and holds a 1.06pc stake in the bank according to Bloomberg data.\nMr Cumming said: “Given the situation, where there is no clear end point in terms of ever increasing capital requirements , and the fact that they are being put at a competitive [dis]advantage, and the fact that we will see better growth, earnings and dividend prospects unless the regulator changes tack then logically we would be supportive of a move if they chose to do that.”\nBut Filippo Alloatti from Hermes disagreed, noting that the British tax regime has improved since the government promised to trim the bank levy in the summer Budget, and that \"concerns about the outlook for the Chinese economy\" could also make a move less appealing.\n\"I don't think they will shift their HQ away from the UK. Being domiciled in the UK comes at a cost but banks are subject to regulatory scrutiny you don't have in China and Hong Kong,\" he said.\n\"Also a bank the size of HSBC will remain a global systemically important bank, no matter of domicile,\" indicating it will still be subject to tighter global rules on capital buffers and charges wherever the bank moves.\n",

REUTERS/Phil Noble\nBy Ben Hirschler | LONDON\nLONDON AstraZeneca is diving deeper into personalized healthcare with two projects that move the concept beyond cancer into respiratory disorders and heart disease.\nPersonalized or precision medicine, which tailors treatment to a patient's genetic profile, is an increasing focus for drug companies, especially after an initiative from U.S. President Barack Obama in January.\nUntil now, however, the focus has been on cancer, where genetic mutations are well-known drivers of disease.\n\"The time is now right to extend the personalized healthcare approach and the benefits it brings to all of our therapy areas,\" Ruth March, who heads the initiative at the British drugmaker, told reporters.\n\"Up to now the science of personalized healthcare has been slower to reach those common disease areas such as cardiovascular and respiratory disease.\"\nTo redress the balance, AstraZeneca said on Wednesday it had signed two deals, one with Abbott Laboratories for a diagnostic test to accompany an experimental asthma drug and another with Canadian scientists on genes associated with heart disease.\nAbbott will develop a diagnostic test to identify patients with severe asthma who are most likely to benefit from AstraZeneca's new antibody drug tralokinumab, which is in final-stage Phase III clinical tests.\nTo date, there are no such approved blood tests for use in asthma.\nA separate tie-up with the Montreal Heart Institute will screen samples from up to 80,000 patients for genetic traits linked to cardiovascular disease and diabetes, in a program that may help doctors work out which patient should take which drug.\nBy 2020, AstraZeneca expects half of its new drug launches will come with so-called companion diagnostics to identify those patients most likely to benefit from different treatments.\nThis approach is already used in cancer, with Roche's breast cancer drug Herceptin and AstraZeneca's lung cancer medicine Iressa, for example, given to patients with particular genetic profiles.\nCancer has long been a key area for AstraZeneca, which was the target of a $118 billion attempted takeover last year by Pfizer.\nAlong with rivals in the field, AstraZeneca will showcase its latest cancer drug advances at the May 29 to June 2 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting in Chicago.\nIndustry analysts say most attention will be focused on the latest clinical data on AstraZeneca's combination of two experimental medicines, MEDI4736 and tremelimumab, in treating lung cancer.\n(Editing by David Holmes)\n",

  "articleText" : "Tim Wallace\n15 February 2016 • 6:45pm\nHSBC took 10 months of sometimes public discussion to decide not to move its global HQ into its Hong Kong office Credit: EPA\nIt is no mean feat to spend 10 months and the efforts of your board and top executives for no discernable benefit. On the face of it, that is all HSBC has done in  deciding to remain headquartered in the UK .\nAt a time of market chaos, geopolitical turmoil and regulatory upheaval, one of the most important banks in the world has taken an extraordinarily long and thorough inspection of its own navel.\nAfter studying the relative merits of moving its headquarters to a range of financial centres all across the globe, HSBC’s board has, unanimously, decided to keep everything as it is.\nChief executive Stuart Gulliver was an early proponent of a move to Hong Kong, a state which he considers his home Credit: Reuters\nIts headquarters will remain in the UK, where the bank has resided since 1993, shortly after it acquired Midland Bank.\nThe bank has done its best to put a positive spin on this major review. Having examined the issue from every conceivable angle, HSBC will, for example, no longer carry out its smaller triennial review of the domicile, which will save it some minor hassle.\nIts directors are now more aware than ever before of the shape of the global business and how it is regulated in  each and every country in which it operates .\nBut did the bank really need to hold a very public and potentially destabilising review of the domicile to achieve this? Surely its directors could have been told to have a good nose around the inner workings of the business a little more closely?\nShortly after HSBC announced the review, Chancellor George Osborne said the bank levy would be cut back and a new UK-specific tax introduced . This was a very poorly designed tax, which was based on an ever-rising percentage of each big UK bank’s balance sheet each year. It hammered HSBC, which has large overseas operations, particularly hard.\nThe timing of the Government’s U-turn has inevitably led to suggestions that HSBC’s review was an implicit feint used to help the UK government see the error of the Bank Levy. If so, it looks like it worked. However, the bank is keen to play down its lobbying efforts and any role it had in getting the levy reduced.\nBut, regardless of the true purpose of the domicile review, it’s not hard to see how it might have reduced HSBC’s political capital.\nThe review threatened to irritate politicians in both of its two main markets, China and the UK.\nThe Chinese authorities were keen for the bank to move back to Hong Kong, as it would burnish the Communist Party’s pro-business credentials if the country could attracting big firms from the West and lure HSBC, which was historically was a Chinese company, back “home”.\nSo, by raising the possibility of returning and then rejecting Chinese governance, the bank has needlessly risked damaging a vital relationship.\nNote the careful and lavish praise the bank heaped on China in the statement that explained its decision to stay in the UK.\nAsia is “a core part” of the bank’s plans, with “its heartland Hong Kong… a top three global financial centre” attracting “increasing shifts in global trade”. The bank plans to  “invest further in the Pearl River Delta”  and expects Hong Kong to play a “pivotal role” in the rise of Asia.\nHSBC praised George Osborne's plan to boost trade with China, but the country's government will still be disappointed the bank did not move its HQ to Hong Kong   Credit: Stefan Roussea/PA\nThe language directed at Mr Osborne and the Bank of England was similarly syrupy.\nHSBC’s statement pushed all of the Chancellor’s policy buttons. Indeed, it reads, in parts, like a Treasury press release: “The UK itself is also positioned to be the leading western financial centre supporting the internationalisation of the renminbi, is growing its trade and investment flows with China, and is building co-operation in key areas of infrastructure financing, 'green’ bond financing and mutual access to traded markets.”\nNaturally this was well-received by Mr Osborne. The Treasury declared the bank’s decision “a vote of confidence in the Government’s economic plan”.\nBut the extraordinary love-in does not mean the bank is gaining influence with policymakers. In fact, the opposite could be true. It suggests that HSBC might be worried that it has lost leverage, with important consequences for future regulation and tax changes.\nIn recognising that the UK is the least-bad country in which to base a bank, HSBC has opened the way for those who want the sector to be shown less leniency.\nRight on queue,  up popped John Vickers, the chairman of the Independent Commission on Banking , on Monday to say that the Bank of England had pulled its punches in implementing his 2011 recommendations and that UK banks need even fatter capital cushions to protect them against the next recession.\nHis intervention was followed by that of Vince Cable, the former business secretary, who suggested that UK banks have the Bank of England wrapped around their little fingers. Interesting timing.\nCritics of banks such as Sir John Vickers have already started circling to demand tougher rules Credit: Bloomberg\nIf HSBC is, as one assumes it must be, several billion pounds better off staying in the UK (why stay otherwise?), there will be many who argue it should spend a good portion of that money in the form of higher taxes or by building up its equity buffers. After all, it can hardly now turn tail and scarper to another country.\nThe UK bank has also put a sizeable hole in  the Government-backed Remain camp’s strategy in the lead-up to the referendum  on the UK’s membership of the European Union.\nThe possiblity of Brexit was one of the reasons HSBC gave for launching its review. But now it has said it will stay - come what may.\nThe bank has said that, should the UK vote to leave the EU, it will send a relatively small number of bankers to Paris. In other words, it won’t take much for City institutions to swerve the negative consequences of Brexit. It’s not hard to imagine how that’s been viewed in Number 10 and 11 Downing Street.\nApplied properly, lobbying can work. Individual voters may or may not think that is a good thing, but it is an important tool for banks operating in a highly-regulated sector.\nRelocation was the trump card in HSBC’s lobbying arsenal. But now it’s been played to little discernable benefit.\nFollow Telegraph Business\n",

  "articleText" : "BHP Billiton share price: Brazil to sue Samarco for Â£3.5bn\nCompany facing more fines\nby Veselin Valchev Monday, 30 Nov 2015, 08:10 GMT\nBrazilian authorities will demand 20 billion reals (Â£3.5 billion) from BHP Billiton Plc (LON:BLT),Vale and their Samarco joint venture, for clean-up costs and environmental damages following the tailings dam burst on November 5, environment minister Izabella Teixeira told reporters on Friday.\nThe lawsuit, expected to be filed later today, will demand that the three companies establish a fund that would see to the long-term remediation of the region.\nâ€œThe action will propose to the court that any value paid by the miners will not be paid to the coffers of the federal government or the states involved in the disaster but to a fund that will be used to finance exclusively actions to repair the damages,â€� the AGU said.\nThe amount of 20 billion reals was estimated based on â€œtechnical reports\" by environmental and water agencies, the government said. The figure, however, is still preliminary and may be increased because the environmental damage caused by the tailings mud to the Atlantic Ocean will not have been calculated, analysts noted.\nBHP said it â€œwill assess the case once it has been filed.\"\nSeparately, Attorney General LuÃ­s InÃ¡cio Adams said Brazilâ€™s environmental agency is planning additional fines against Samarco. A Â£43.6 million fine has already been issued, while last week the company agreed to allocate one billion reals to an emergency fund.\nThe disaster killed 13 people, while six more are still missing. Water supplies to a quarter-million people have also been contaminated, while the Rio Doce riverâ€™s ecosystem has been decimated.\nEarlier on Friday, BHP and Vale announced that the two companies will establish a â€œvoluntary, non-profit fund to support the rescue and recuperation of the Rio Doce river system.â€�\nThe size of the fund was not revealed, as BHP noted that \"the total cost of damage has not been calculated yet.â€� According to the Australian Financial Review, the â€œRiver Doceâ€� fund will run over a decade and would allocate at least $200 million.\nThe two companies will initially sponsor the fund, but the aim is to secure additional support from other private, public and non-government organisations.\nâ€œThe Fund would focus on supporting the remediation of the river as part of the commitment of Vale, BHP Billiton and Samarco to the aquatic environment following the release of the tailings into the Doce basin,â€� BHP and Vale said in a joint statement on Friday.\nMeanwhile, BHP reiterated today that analysis by the Brazilian Geological Service (CPRM) has confirmed that concentrations of metals in the Rio Doce in the period from November 14 â€“ 18 â€œdo not significantly differ from the results produced by CPRM in 2010.â€�\nA separate analysis by an independent company has also confirmed that the tailings are composed of materials that are â€œnot hazardous to human health, based on the hazard classification of the material under Brazilian standards.â€�\nLast week, the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights said â€œnew evidenceâ€� had shown that the mud which burst from Samarcoâ€™s tailings dam was toxic. BHP said in response that â€œthe tailings are chemically stable â€� and â€œwill behave in the environment like normal soils in the catchment.â€�\nThe Samarco dam disaster \"will prove to be the straw that breaks the camelâ€™s back on BHPâ€™s progressive dividend,â€� JP Morgan said last week. The bank predicted a 50-percent dividend cut , while it also downgraded the miner to â€œunderweightâ€� and lowered its price target to A$18 (861p), down from A$27.\nBHPâ€™s share price opened on the downside today, dropping 2.29 percent to a fresh seven-year low of 789.50p. Since the dam breach on November 5, BHPâ€™s stock has lost more than 23 percent.\n",

  "articleText" : "Should you buy Associated British Foods plc, Great Portland Estates plc and Dunelm Group plc following today’s news?\nBy Motley Fool | Thu, 7th July 2016 - 10:53\nDemand for Associated British Foods (\nLSE\n:ABF) has exploded out of the blocks in Thursday trade, the stock gaining 8% following a bubbly trading update. Investors piled-in after the result of sterling's weakness was revealed by the Primark operator. Associated British Foods advised that \"we expect a bigger translation benefit in the final quarter with no material transactional effect at current rates.\"\nAssociated British Foods added that \"our outlook for this financial year has improved and we no longer expect a decline in adjusted earnings per share for the group for the full year.\"\nThe retailer sourced around half of total profits from overseas last year. And with the pound continuing to plummet, the situation is looking rosier for Associated British Foods.\nOn top of this, while much of the retail sector could come under pressure from a cooling UK economy, footfall at Primark could ignite as shoppers flock towards low-price clothes.\nOn paper, Associated British Foods may appear expensive, the firm dealing on a forward\nP/E\nrating of 26.7 times. But I reckon hefty upgrades to earnings forecasts could be just around the corner.\nWithdrawal symptoms\nProperty play Great Portland Estates (LSE:GPOR) also carried higher on Thursday, the firm 3% higher as I write. But this isn't to say the jitters surrounding the commercial property sector won't send the stock price sinking again.\nGreat Portland warned that \"it is likely that the uncertainty created by the EU referendum result will have a negative impact on economic growth in London,\" with firms deferring investment decisions as Britain negotiates its exit from the Union.\nConsequently, Great Portland noted that \"we can expect London's commercial property markets to weaken during this period of uncertainty with the benefits of lower bond yields and weaker sterling offset by reduced rental growth prospects.\"\nWith concerns looming over a protracted and unfavourable exit period, not to mention the possibility of a severe British recession, Great Portland could find itself under significant pressure in the months and years ahead. And I reckon a forward P/E rating of 43.2 times fails to account for these risks.\nSales sliding\nFurniture flogger Dunelm Group (LSE:DNLM) completed the set with a 0.4% share value advance on Thursday.\nThe retailer advised of \"volatile trading through [Q4] driven by changeable weather conditions and a general retail slowdown prior to the EU referendum.\" Like-for-like sales at Dunelm dipped 0.6% during the 13 weeks to 2 July, it announced, continuing the steady decline witnessed in recent quarters.\nAnd things could get a lot more difficult as shoppers put off purchases of non-essential goods. Indeed, Dunelm commented that \"the current uncertainty makes the future trajectory of the economy and consumer confidence unclear.\"\nAs such, I reckon cautious investors should sit on the sidelines for the time being, particularly as Dunelm's forward P/E rating of 15.9 times can hardly be considered unmissable value.\nRoyston Wild has no position in any shares mentioned. The Motley Fool UK has no position in any of the shares mentioned.

  "articleText" : "Barclays hit with record fine as six banks settle forex scandal\n \nThursday 21 May 2015 00:37 BST\nClick to follow\nThe Independent Online\nBarclays and Royal Bank of Scotland were among a group of six global banks fined almost $6bn (£3.9bn) for rigging the $5.3trn-a-day foreign exchange market.\nThe settlement with US and UK regulators, which also involved JP Morgan, Citigroup, Bank of America and UBS, means that the scandal has so far cost the global industry about $10bn. The affair follows a series of scandals, including the fixing of benchmark interest rate Libor, that have severely damaged the public’s perception of the banking industry.\nBarclays, Citi, JP Morgan, UBS and RBS also all pleaded guilty to a US antitrust violation. Forex traders were said to have come together in chat-rooms with names﻿ such as  “The Cartel” or the “Bandits’ Club” to organise methods to influence the value of major currencies in the hope of inflating their profits.\n“If you ain’t cheating, you ain’t trying,” one Barclays’ trader said in a chatroom.\nAnyone from hedge funds betting on the market to a company engaging in a major overseas transaction could have been affected.\n“This sort of practice strikes at the heart of business ethics and is yet another blow to the integrity of the banks,” said Mark Taylor, dean of Warwick Business School and a former foreign exchange trader.\n“Our pension funds invest billions of pounds in the financial markets and if they are being cheated in this way, it affects every one of us.”\nBarclays, which opted out of a mass settlement last year in which six banks agreed to pay a total of £2.6bn, was fined the largest amount, at £1.53bn; that included City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority’s largest ever penalty of £284.4m.\nThe FCA said the bank failed “to control business practices in its foreign exchange business in London”, and the issue extended across the spot currency markets, “undermining confidence in the UK financial system and putting its integrity at risk”.\nGeorgina Philippou, the FCA’s acting director of enforcement added: “Instead of addressing the obvious risks associated with its business, Barclays allowed a culture to develop which put the firm’s interests ahead of those of its clients.”\nThe bank, which had set aside about £2bn to cover its bill, also settled with the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS), the US Department of Justice and the the US Federal Reserve.\nThe DFS’s Benjamin Lawsky said: “[Barclays employees] engaged in a brazen ‘heads I win, tails you lose’ scheme to rip off their clients.” Mr Lawsky, who has a reputation as a hard-line regulator, also announced he is stepping down in June to start his own legal firm.\nRBS took part in November’s settlement but said it would pay another $669m to the DoJ and Federal Reserve to resolve the investigations.\nBanks have suspended, put on leave or fired a number of staff for their involvement in market manipulation. Barclays sacked another eight employees as part of its settlement.\nJake Robbins, at Premier Asset Management, said: “Since the financial crisis, closer regulatory scrutiny has led to a string of fines in the banking sector and has largely been accepted as an ongoing increased cost of doing business.\n“While each time banks incur fines for bad behaviour it clearly impacts their profits, fines are typically very small compared to annual earnings, so ultimately have little impact on their overall business, valuation or prospects.”\n",

  "articleText" : "Share on Pinterest\nThe British government deliberately withheld the release of a damaging fracking report to prevent local councillors from scrutinising it ahead of a crucial vote on shale gas drilling, according to an ongoing Energydesk investigation.\nDocuments obtained under the Freedom of Information Act show for the first time how ministers, including Andrea Leadsom, worked together to limit damage to the fracking industry from a previously censored report, after being forced to publish it in full by the Information Commissioner.\nThe internal emails reveal the government’s strategy to delay and discredit the report by publishing it days after the council vote on a busy news day and having the environment department (Defra), which commissioned the study, “lead on knocking the report down”.\nMarcus Johnstone, Lancashire County Council’s cabinet member for planning, who passed a motion calling for the report’s release before the crucial vote, said the government displayed “complete contempt for local democracy”.\nThe study, which details the negative impacts of fracking on the rural economy , was a source of major controversy in the summer of 2014 after it was released with entire chapters redacted following a freedom of information request by Energydesk.  \nRead the emails here\nFreedom of information battle\nThe release of the latest documents was delayed by over a year, with the energy department extending the freedom of information deadline 14 times — before another investigation by the Information Commissioner prompted their publication.\nThe emails reveal how current environment secretary Andrea Leadsom, then at Decc, coordinated with Number 10 and Defra to prevent the report’s publication until after Lancashire County Council voted on two applications to frack by Cuadrilla.\nMinisters were aware that the Information Commissioner had ruled that there was “a strong public interest” in releasing it unredacted, but chose to delay until as late as possible in the 35 day window they were given.\nThe emails further show that the controversy surrounding the report prompted Leadsom, who is now secretary of state at Defra, to insist on being notified of any controversial freedom of information requests in future because of “her sensitivity to shale comms at the moment”.\nLancashire’s decision to reject Cuadrilla’s fracking applications has since been overturned\nBurying bad news\nThe unredacted report was eventually released on 1 July 2015, just two days after Lancashire councillors voted to turn down Cuadrilla’s applications and on the same day as the long-awaited Davies Commission report on airport expansion. The emails reveal that Defra planned the timing of the release for “quite late in the day” – possibly to limit media scrutiny.\nThe sections of the report the government attempted to hide through redaction discuss the potentially damaging impacts of fracking on communities neighbouring exploration sites. They include references to water contamination, noise and air pollution, falling house prices, and damage to local industries like tourism and agriculture.\nOne particularly incendiary line reads: “properties located within a 1-5 mile radius of the fracking operation may also incur an additional cost of insurance to cover losses in case of explosion on the site”.\nResponding to the news, Councillor Marcus Johnstone, said:\n“It is dirty tricks of the highest order – a real eye opener. It shows complete contempt for local democracy. It is very obvious they were hell bent on fracking happening anyway, whatever we said in Lancashire.”\nShadow energy minister Alan Whitehead MP said: “this is a sorry saga of evasion and deceit, which only serves to strengthen the now widely held opinion that Government is determined to push through fracking regardless of facts or debate, and has actively connived to subvert inconvenient analysis when it surfaces.”\nEnergydesk submitted a similar freedom of information request to Defra in August 2015, the deadline for which has been extended by the department 16 times. It is yet to be released.\nLeadsom emails\nOn 15 June 2015, Andrea Leadsom’s private secretary emailed the director of the Office of Unconventional Gas and Oil (OUGO), Emily Bourne, regarding the Information Commissioner’s ruling that Defra had to publish the report unredacted.\nThe email says that Leadsom: “suggests we do nothing before Cuadrilla’s planning decision if we have time” and asks “if the Minister should be aware or if we expect any media pick up from the FOI, particularly given her sensitivity to shale comms at the moment.”\nIn a draft reply to Leadsom, Bourne agreed to pass on Leadsom’s suggestion to Defra: “we will make sure they are aware of the Minister’s views.”\nLeadsom “suggests we do nothing before Cuadrilla’s planning decision if we have time”\nOn 16 June, Bourne wrote to Leadsom confirming that Defra “will set up a meeting with us, No. 10 and others to discuss timing but they are thinking first week of July.” This would be after the Lancashire planning decision was due to be made.\nThen, on the 23 June, an email from a Decc civil servant to Amber Rudd, Andrea Leadsom, OUGO and the Treasury outlined how, during a Lancashire County Council hearing on the planning applications: “There were requests to defer consideration until publication of the Defra Rural Impacts Report. The Council’s legal team advised that they proceed with the discussion”.\nDespite this, the government proceeded with its plans to delay publication until after the Lancashire decision. On 24 June Leadsom’s private secretary wrote to Decc’s communication department and other ministers: “As discussed, I’ve had a message passed to me that Liz Truss’ office have apparently confirmed that the DEFRA Rural Impacts Report will be published on 1st July (and No.10 have agreed with this).”\nIt was eventually published around 5pm on July 1, at a time when headlines were dominated by the Davies Commission’s decision to back a third runway at Heathrow.\nFracking ‘double standard’\nThe emails offer a rare insight into the government’s efforts to protect the UK’s nascent fracking industry from public criticism.\nOne email, a draft briefing for David Cameron ahead of a PMQs session on 24 June reveals the government’s sensitivity to allegations of a “double standard” between the planning regimes for fracking and onshore wind.\nUnder “lines to take” OUGO posed the following question:\nLancashire County Council’s refusal of Cuadrilla’s fracking applications has since been overturned by the planning inspector.\nAlan Whitehead, told Energydesk that the briefing: “indicates that the department knew it was operating a double standard on wind and shale objections by local communities, but was prepared to invent a completely specious line about local communities and fracking to cover their blushes.”\nMarcus Johnstone said: “The double standard [between wind and fracking applications] is jaw dropping”.\nOn 30 June, as the publication of the report neared, Leadsom wrote to civil servants in Decc’s communications department, as well as energy secretary Amber Rudd, asking what the plan was: “Do you know when we expect the handling plan to come through and what sort of involvement are you anticipating?”\nThe communications department replied three minutes later outlining how: “Defra will lead on knocking the report down. We (DECC) might need to comment on the Government’s shale policy more generally and we’ll probably get together a couple of top lines to basically respond to the question why have we ignored this report when formulating our shale policy.”\nWhen contacted for comment a Government spokesperson said: “We complied fully with the Information Commissioner’s ruling that we publish the report within the established timescales.\nAs the material made clear, we do not believe this internal document – which was incomplete and had not been peer-reviewed – was sufficiently analytically robust to inform policy-making.”\n",

It also closed 21 supermarkets, axed 720 jobs at its head office and sold 140 of its convenience stores.\nAlthough FTSE 100 relegation would make \"little difference to the broader business\", Chris Beauchamp, of IG, said it is \"a recognition that the big four supermarkets have still failed to find the cure to their ongoing ills\".\nThe stock closed in negative territory - down 2.6pc at 152.3p.\nAccording to Jefferies, the quarterly shake-up could also see payments processor Worldpay - the UK’s largest IPO this year - and Irish distribution company DCC join the blue chip index.\nAfter analysing the constituents rankings after markets closed on Friday, the broker said Worldpay ranked number 69 in the FTSE 350, while Provident Financial was at 73 and DCC had a ranking of 78, which suggested the three companies would enjoy “automatic inclusion in the FTSE 100”.\nDCC graph (Source: Bloomberg)\nEarlier this month, shares in DCC touched a record high after the group reported a 26.1pc jump in its half-year operating profit buoyed by robust performances in its energy and healthcare businesses.\nJustin Jordan, of Jefferies, said DCC’s potential entry into the FTSE 100 “broadens its pool of potential investors and boosts profile and credibility in discussions on possible M&A opportunities”.\nHowever, the shake-up is also expected to see security group G4S and British engineer Meggitt face relegation from the FTSE 100.\nAn official decision will be made on Wednesday and all changes will take effect from the start of trading on Monday, December 21.\n",

  "articleText" : "June 1, 2015 | 03:28AM PT\nMammoth Screen's 'Poldark,' above, has been a critical and ratings hit in the U.K.\nU.K. television broadcasting and production giant ITV has acquired Mammoth Screen, the indie behind the BBC’s critical and ratings hit “ Poldark ,” and one of the U.K.’s leading scripted production companies.\nMammoth Screen has produced a raft of high-end drama since it was established in 2007, including “Endeavour” for ITV and “Parade’s End” for BBC and HBO. Alongside “Poldark” season two and “Endeavour” season three, the team are working on new series commissions including “Victoria” for ITV, “Tripped” for E4 and “Book of the Dead” for The Weinstein Company.\nITV has held a 25% equity investment in Mammoth Screen since 2007, and has now acquired the remaining 75% of the company. As part of the original deal, ITV Studios’ distribution business, ITV Studios Global Entertainment, has an existing agreement to exclusively distribute Mammoth Screen’s productions, which has seen “Endeavour” air in more than 180 countries. “Poldark,” which had an average audience of 8.2 million viewers in the U.K., was recently launched to the international television market with deals agreed with broadcasters around the world including Australia, New Zealand, Sweden and Canada.\nMammoth Screen’s Damien Timmer will lead the business as managing director. Before establishing the company, Timmer was head of drama for ITV Productions, overseeing a wide slate of returning scripted series including “Lewis,” “Marple” and the BAFTA winning “Housewife 49.”\nCo-founder Michele Buck will step down as joint managing director. However, along with taking-up new opportunities in the wider industry, Buck will remain as executive producer on “Agatha Raisin,” “A Tale of Two Cities” and “Lewis,” which she produces with ITV Studios.\nJulian Bellamy, managing director ITV Studios UK, said: “Damien and the team are one of the most impressive and sought after drama producers in Britain. From ‘Endeavour’ to ‘Poldark,’ they’ve an uncanny knack of developing hit after hit and we’re delighted they’re joining the ITV Studios family.”\nTimmer added: “This move will allow Mammoth to make even more ambitious drama, working with the best creative talent in the business. We have a long history with ITV Studios, and with its support and backing we’ll be able to make television for a wide range of partners both at home and abroad, whilst remaining a very British television company.”\nMammoth’s senior team going forward includes Rebecca Keane as creative director, Preethi Mavahalli and Karen Thrussell as executive producers, James Penny as commercial director, Jon Williams as director of production and finance, and Ronnie Castillo as head of production.\nFiled Under:\n",

  "articleText" : "Bonds News | Tue Dec 8, 2015 | 4:36pm EST\nRPT-UPDATE 2-Former Jefferies trader Litvak's conviction overturned\n(Repeats to add link to Breaking Views article)\nBy Jonathan Stempel\nDec 8 A federal appeals court on Tuesday overturned the conviction of a former Jefferies Group Inc trader accused of lying to investors about mortgage bond prices, in a setback to government efforts to fight Wall Street fraud after the financial crisis.\nThe 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York also ordered that Jesse Litvak, the former trader, be retried on some charges, despite a lack of evidence that his misstatements were material to the U.S. government.\nProsecutors said the government was a victim because some of Litvak's customers handled money for the U.S. Treasury Department's Troubled Asset Relief Program, and that his lies impeded efforts to restart the mortgage debt market.\nWriting for a 3-0 appeals court panel, Circuit Judge Chester Straub also said the trial judge was wrong to exclude expert testimony on Litvak's behalf with regard to the securities fraud counts, and that this error was not harmless.\nBut he said \"a rational jury could have found that Litvak's misrepresentations were material\" to customers, and ordered a new trial on the 10 securities fraud counts.\nThe defendant was the first person charged under a 2009 law banning major fraud against the United States through TARP.\nTuesday's decision voids his conviction on one TARP fraud count and four counts of making false statements.\nU.S. Attorney Deirdre Daly said she was \"gratified\" that the panel upheld the government's securities fraud theory, and that her office \"will proceed with retrying\" the securities fraud charges.\n\"Today's opinion affirms the government's ongoing efforts to investigate and prosecute fraud in the fixed-income markets,\" Daly said in a statement.\nKannon Shanmugam, a lawyer for Litvak, said: \"We're very pleased with today's decision.\"\nThe decision could help lawyers representing defendants in two similar criminal cases brought by Daly's office.\nOn Sept. 8, Daly announced fraud and conspiracy charges against former Nomura Holdings Inc traders Ross Shapiro, Michael Gramins and Tyler Peters for cheating their customers.\nIn the other case, bond trader Matthew Katke pleaded guilty in March to cheating customers at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, but retained the right to withdraw his plea if the 2nd Circuit voided Litvak's conviction.\nFRUSTRATING TREASURY NOT ENOUGH\nLitvak had been free on bail while he appealed his March 2014 conviction and two-year prison term.\nProsecutors said Litvak misled customers, including participants in TARP's Public-Private Investment Program, about bond prices from 2009 to 2011, helping Jefferies boost profit by $2.25 million and his own pay, which he thought too low.\nIn voiding the TARP fraud conviction, Straub found a lack of evidence that Litvak's conduct was \"reasonably capable of influencing a decision of the Treasury,\" even if it was relevant to that agency and frustrated its investment goals.\nHe also said Chief Judge Janet Hall of the New Haven, Connecticut, federal court, who oversaw Litvak's trial, erred in excluding testimony from Ram Willner, a portfolio manager.\nWillner was to testify that investors who negotiate with bond traders like Litvak would widely consider statements from such traders \"biased\" and often misleading.\nStraub said excluding Willner's testimony was unfair to Litvak by making it too hard to rebut testimony that his misstatements mattered to investors with whom he dealt.\nJefferies, a unit of Leucadia National Corp, in March 2014 entered a non-prosecution agreement and agreed to pay $25 million to end U.S. probes of its supervision of Litvak and other traders.\nMarc Mukasey, a lawyer for former Nomura trader Gramins, said: \"The government's case has been gutted by the Second Circuit. It's heartening to know that the rule of law still prevails in these days of government overreach.\"\nLawyers for the other Nomura defendants did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Richard Albert, a lawyer for Katke, said he is reviewing the decision.\nThe case is Litvak v. U.S., 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 14-2902.\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Dan Grebler)\nNext In Bonds News\nEMERGING MARKETS-Brazil real falls on potential Temer probe\nBy Bruno Federowski     SAO PAULO, Nov 25 Brazil's currency fell on Friday on concerns that fiscal reforms could be derailed by a potential investigation into whether President Michel Temer pressured an ex-minister to favor a cabinet colleague's property investment.

The performance was the worst in what was another bleak period for grocers, as sales grew by just 0.1 percent across the industry.\n“Slow growth means a distinct lack of seasonal cheer for the market,\" Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar Worldpanel, said in the statement. “All supermarkets are cutting prices, particularly on staples like eggs and butter.\"\nDeflation worsened to 1.9 percent as the price war sparked by Aldi and Lidl showed no sign of abating. The German discounters, who now account for 10 percent of the U.K.’s grocery spend, are likely to attract about 10 million shoppers over the Christmas period, Kantar said.\nJ Sainsbury Plc outperformed its large rivals with sales growth of 1.2 percent, sending the stock as much as 4.4 percent higher. The growth was achieved across the company’s supermarket, convenience and online businesses, Kantar said. Wal-Mart Stores Inc.’s Asda continued to struggle, with sales dropping by 3.4 percent and sales at Wm Morrison Supermarkets Plc declined by 2 percent.\nDespite the decline in sales, the battered share prices of U.K. supermarkets rose. Tesco advanced as much as 3.3 percent to 147.7 pence, having closed at its lowest level since 1997 yesterday. Morrison rose as much as 3.9 percent to 145.6 pence.\nMarket sentiment around the sector has been at a low ebb. Short selling, where investors seek to profit from a falling share price, is near record levels at each of the three listed U.K. grocers, according to data from Markit.\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Lynch | WASHINGTON\nWASHINGTON Barclays (BARC.L) and Credit Suisse CSGN.VX have settled federal and state charges that they misled investors in their dark pools, with Barclays admitting it broke the law and agreeing to pay $70 million, federal and New York state officials said on Sunday.\nThe settlements between the banks and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York state attorney general mark the two largest fines ever paid in connection with cases involving dark pools.\nThe amount to be paid, in fines and disgorgement, is a combined total of $154.3 million.\nAt the heart of the cases against both Barclays and Credit Suisse are allegations they misled investors in the dark pools, saying they would be protected from predatory high-frequency trading tactics.\nBarclays will pay a $70 million fine split evenly between the SEC and New York state, admit it violated securities laws and agree to install an independent monitor to ensure that its dark pool \"Barclays LX\" operates properly in the future.\nCredit Suisse will pay a $60 million fine split between the regulators, plus an additional $24.3 million in disgorgement to the SEC for executing 117 million illegal sub-penny orders out of its dark pool known as \"Crossfinder.\"\nDark pools are trading venues that differ from public exchanges because orders are not visible to other traders until they are executed.\nThe lack of pre-trade price information is designed to help institutional investors trade large blocks of shares without the market moving against them.\nAs part of the settlement, Credit Suisse will neither admit nor deny the allegations.\nA Credit Suisse spokeswoman said the bank was pleased to have resolved the matters with the SEC and the New York attorney general.\nA Barclays representative said the bank was pleased to resolve the case as it will enable the company to focus its efforts on serving clients.\nThe settlement with Barclays marks a dramatic end to a high-stakes public legal battle between the bank and New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman.\nSchneiderman's office filed a lawsuit against Barclays in June 2014 alleging fraud in its dark pool.\nThe lawsuit alleged that the bank told investors it had a \"liquidity profiling\" service that was meant to let traditional investors opt out of trading with high-speed traders.\nIn fact, Schneiderman's office said, the program was riddled with \"exceptions\" that favored high-speed traders.\nThe bank also disseminated trading analysis materials to investors that intentionally deleted its largest and most aggressive trader, Schneiderman's office said.\nThe lawsuit came after the furor over Michael Lewis' book \"Flash Boys,\" which charged the stock market was rigged in favor of high-frequency traders.\nBarclays lost a bid to have the case dismissed last year.\n\"These cases mark the first major victory in the fight against fraud in dark pool trading that began when we first sued Barclays,\" Schneiderman said in an emailed statement. \"We will continue to take the fight to those who aim to rig the system and those who look the other way.\"\nSEC Chair Mary Jo White said in a statement: \"These cases are the most recent in a series of strong SEC enforcement actions involving dark pools and other alternative trading systems.\nShe added that the agency \"will continue to shed light on dark pools to better protect investors.”\nRegulators did not charge any individuals at the banks in connection with the two cases.\nHowever, Schneiderman's office said that Barclays made personnel changes after the lawsuit was filed by removing two employees in the electronic trading group from their supervisory roles.\n(Reporting by Sarah N.

  "articleText" : "Add Your Note (Optional):\n \nLONDON (Alliance News) - Builders' merchant and home improvement retailer Travis Perkins PLC on Tuesday hiked its interim dividend by 20% on the back of a rise in profit driven by stronger revenue and robust like-for-like sales growth.\nBut shares in the company sunk in morning trade amid concerns about its reliance on an improvement in market conditions in the second half and as its shares trade close to highs.\nThe FTSE 100-listed company, which runs the Wickes DIY chain along with plumbing and heating and contract merchanting businesses, said its pretax profit for the six months to the end of June was GBP158.6 million, up from GBP153.7 million a year earlier.\nRevenue for the group was up to GBP2.94 billion in the half, from GBP2.73 billion a year earlier, as like-for-like revenue grew 5.7%. Travis saw good sales growth in its general merchanting, contract merchanting and consumer businesses in the half, though it saw a small decline from its plumbing and heating business.\nTravis said it will pay an interim dividend of 14.75 pence per share, up 20% year-on-year on the back of the strong result and its confidence on its outlook for the second half.\n\"The group has delivered a strong underlying performance in the first half. Our key strategic priorities are unchanged: modernising general merchanting, transforming Wickes and completing the plumbing and heating re-segmentation programme. We continue to anticipate a full-year result in line with expectations and are delivering on our targets, including low double-digit profit growth and sales outperformance of our markets,\" said Chief Executive John Carter.\nDespite the rise in profit, shares in Travis were trading down 3.0% to 2,193.00 pence, one of the worst performers in the FTSE 100. Augustin Eden, an analyst at Accendo Markets, said \"it appears that simply stating that 'there are signs of recovery' in the only market whose department posted a decline are not enough for shareholders\", referring to Travis's plumbing and heating business.\nEden added that investors may think shares in the company looks a bit expensive given they are currently around pre-2008 levels.\nAnalysts were mixed on the results too, with Davy Securities saying Travis' first half was weaker than it expected. Flor O'Donoghue, a Davy analyst, said the first half performance leaves the company with \"considerable ground to make up\" in the second half.\nBut Panmure Gordon disagreed, saying Travis will benefit from a mostly positive near-term macroeconomic environment in the UK. \"The broad portfolio of distribution brands is clearly performing well and given the near-term macro environment we expect positive trends are maintained,\" said Panmure analyst Adrian Kearsey, though he said there appears to be little short-term upside to Travis's share price.\nThe only decline in revenue on a divisional basis for Travis came from its plumbing and heating business, though it said it is seeing signs of recovery in the unit, particularly from the local bathroom installer market. Travis said heating market conditions continue to be tough amid competitive pricing for both its Plumbing Trade Supplies and its F&P Wholesale businesses.\nTravis said revenue in the division declined in line with its expectations, down 0.7% in total and down by 2.9% on a like-for-like basis, due to the non-recurrence of sales linked to the Energy Company Obligation Scheme in the UK, tougher market conditions, and disruption to the division from the re-segmentation programme, under which Travis is converting its branches to retool the weighting each sub-segment of the plumbing and heating unit has.\nThe group said the re-segmentation process is on track, with 45 branch conversions from the PTS brand to City Plumbing completed in the half, bringing the total number of conversions to 94 out of a planned 180. A further 25 branches were closed in the half where the sites were not considered to be well-positioned.\nThe rest of Travis Perkins' business units all delivered robust sales growth in the half, however, with its core general merchanting arm posting total revenue growth of 7.8%, with like-for-like sales rising by 6.7%. Sales in the unit outperformed the wider market, Travis said, with growth particularly strong in heavy side building materials categories.\nOperating margins in the merchanting division were broadly flat in the half, with good progress in sourcing initiatives and solid price inflation pass-through, offset by continued investments in the business. It said its modernisation plans are on track, with more than 400 of its branches now served by heavy-side range centres, which has improved the availability of heavy-side products and resulted in sales rises for those branches supplied by the centres.\nThe strongest area of growth in the half was contract merchanting, where revenue increased by 18% in the half on the back of very strong growth for Travis's Keyline heavy-side and civil projects merchanting business and for its CCF insultation, dry-lining and partitioning distributor. Gross margin in the division was dragged down by 120 basis points, however, thanks to higher sales growth in lower-margin businesses, a shift towards heavy-side products at Keyline and competitive pricing for the BSS heating and ventilation distribution business.\nRevenue in Travis' consumer DIY business was up by 8.6% in the half, with like-for-like sales rising 6.5%. Margins were maintained in the unit while the expansion of the Toolstation business is on track, it said, with 18 branches opened in the first half, meaning it now has 202 branches of the trade tools, accessories and hardware retailer in the UK and the Netherlands.\nThe consumer arm also benefited from a continued improvement for Wickes and encouraging growth in the Tile Giant business. Online sales for Wickes also increased in the half and now represent 8% of total sales for the business, Travis said.\nBy Sam Unsted; samunsted@alliancenews.com; @SamUAtAlliance\nCopyright 2015 Alliance News Limited.

George Conway, a U.S. lawyer representing Tesco, declined to comment.\nTesco was sued after revealing in September 2014 that it had overstated first-half profit by 250 million pounds ($378 million) because it incorrectly booked payments from suppliers.\nThat led to the price of Tesco's American depositary shares falling 15 percent on the next trading day. Tesco later raised the estimated overstatement to 263 million pounds.\nThe scandal led to the departure of several top executives, probes by Britain's Serious Fraud Office and other regulators, and the replacement of Tesco's longtime auditor.\nWednesday's settlement covers investors led by Stephen Klug, and who sought class-action status on behalf of those who acquired Tesco's American depositary shares and \"F-shares\" between April 18, 2012 and Sept. 22, 2014, court papers show.\nThe lawsuit claimed that Tesco and top executives misled investors into believing the company was performing well, when it was instead reporting profit incorrectly, taking too long to recognize costs, and overstating inventory.\nKim Miller, a partner at Kahn Swick & Foti representing Klug, in a court filing called the settlement an \"outstanding recovery\" given the risks of continued litigation.\nThe average recovery will be 37 cents per American depositary share and 11 cents per F-share before deducting fees and expenses, court papers show.\nKahn Swick & Foti plan to seek legal fees of up to 30 percent of the gross settlement fund, the papers show.\nThe case is In re: Tesco PLC Securities Litigation, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 14-08495.

What’s key this time around is it “shows that HSBC [is] considering all options to maximize value for shareholders,” said Berenberg analyst James Chappell, in a note Monday.\n“We continue to believe HSBC is undervalued considering its 6% yield and that there has been significant change already in the business,” Chappell added.\nHSBC said Friday it is thinking about moving its headquarters out of London as it assesses changes in the U.K. regulatory landscape.

Group revenue declined five percent to Â£1.55 billion.\nMeggitt CEO Stephen Young said: \"2014 was a challenging year for the Group, exacerbated by the impact of external factors including a significant foreign exchange headwind.\" He added, however, that the group expected organic revenue growth in 2015 of low to midâ€‘single digit percentage points, in line with guidance given in November. Reflecting its confidence in the groupâ€™s future performance, the board raised its final dividend by eight percent to 9.50p, resulting in a full-year dividend of 13.75p â€“ eight percent up on 2013.\nIn a separate statement today, Meggitt said it had won a multi-million dollar contract from China's AVIC Aircraft Xi'an Branch to conduct three packages of work for the MA700 70-seat regional aircraft. The joint development phase involves two fire protection systems, one for the engine and auxiliary power unit and the other for the cargo and cabin, and a bleed air leak detection system. Without disclosing the financial terms of the deal, Meggitt said that first delivery is planned for 2019 with production expected to last at least 25 years.\nBy 09:42 GMT, Meggittâ€™s share price had slumped 2.80 percent to 554.99p. According to the Financial Times, the 17 analysts projecting 12 month price targets for the FTSE 100-listed group have a median target of 530.00p, with a high estimate of 698.00p and a low of 435.00p.

The ratio was 13 percent at the end of March.\nThe shares will entitle MUFJ to receive a fixed dividend of 5 percent a year. The dividend will be non-cumulative and payable at Aberdeen's discretion.\n\"The ability to generate organic growth through the launch of new funds will be enhanced if the company is able to commit increased levels of seed capital so that the funds are launched at a level at which they will be considered credible,\" the asset manager said on Monday.\nAt 1212 GMT Aberdeen shares were down 2 percent, lagging a 1.1 percent weaker FTSE 100 index.\nEmerging markets-focused Aberdeen has been hit hard by heavy outflows recently, with investors bailing out because of the increasing likelihood of an interest rate rise in the United States.\nRBC Capital Markets analyst Peter Lenardos said he was surprised by the move, given Aberdeen's stated goal of returning surplus capital to shareholders.\nIn May Aberdeen announced a share buyback programme of up to 100 million pounds, to be conducted over the rest of the year.\n\"While we view a conversion of the shares as unlikely, we believe today's announcement signals that Aberdeen is having organic growth issues and could be subject to increased regulatory capital requirements,\" Lenardos wrote in a note to clients.\nAberdeen, however, said it is well placed with regard to its capital buffers and remains committed to its share buyback plan.\n\"The purpose of the preference share issue is to enable the provision of increased seed capital without impacting the use of the group's existing resources,\" the company said in a separate statement to Reuters.\n\"The preference shares are an efficient form of capital that are recognised as an element of regulatory capital and, with a fixed coupon of 5 percent, the cost of capital is considerably lower than ordinary shares,\" it added.

  "articleText" : "Sales boost for new Morrisons chief David Potts as Tesco turnaround stalls\n \nSimon Neville\nTuesday 2 June 2015 09:09 BST\nGreen shoots: Morrisons' sales rose in the first hint of a recovery at the supermarket (Picture: Sean Dempsey, PA)\nMorrisons’ new boss David Potts was given a welcome boost today as the struggling supermarket managed to increase sales for the first time in 18 months and was the only one of the Big Four grocers where sales rose.\nRivals Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury’s all saw sales shrink as the entrenched price war continues, but Potts managed to give himself some breathing space ahead of a what is likely to be fiery annual general meeting on Thursday.\nThe event could see shareholders revolt over payouts to ousted boss Dalton Philips.\nSales rose just 0.1% in the 12 weeks to May 24 compared with a year earlier, according to Kantar Worldpanel, but analysts said this was a symbolic victory for the supermarket which is set to be dumped out of the FTSE 100 later this week.\nFraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said: “A committed core of loyal Morrisons consumers is responding positively to recent initiatives and business has been boosted online.”\nThe supermarket signed a 25-year deal with Ocado two years ago, at a cost of £220 million, to offer online services decades after its rivals had already established strong internet growth.\nMcKevitt added that Morrisons’ premium own-label lines — which command higher margins than branded goods — were also performing well for the first time. By comparison, there was concern over market leader Tesco and Asda, which saw sales fall harder than the other supermarkets on the High Street.\n \nTesco saw sales fall 1.3% and lost market share, from 29% a year ago to 28.6% today, with Kantar revealing that sales in the grocer’s big-box stores were falling faster than all its competitors.\nChief executive Dave Lewis has already shut down 42 larger stores.\n At Asda there was also disappointment as boss Andy Clarke’s steadfast refusal to engage in the heavy discounting which has flooded the sector continued to send sales down.\n#GroceryMarketShare figures for 12wks to 24/05: Tesco 28.6% Asda 16.6% Sainsburys 16.5% Morrisons 10.9% CoOp 6.0% Aldi 5.4% Waitrose 5.2%\n— Kantar Worldpanel UK (@KWP_UK) June 2, 2015\nKantar said they fell 2.4% — making Asda the worst performing of all the supermarkets — and come a week after Clarke announced that sales for the first quarter dropped 3.9% and warned that 2015 remained challenging.\nThere was some good news for the supermarkets, however, as the price deflation which has plagued the market for more than a year showed signs of easing off.\nRelated stories\n",

  "articleText" : "The Latest: Buffett says cuts will pay off at Kraft Heinz\nBy The Associated Press\nOMAHA, Neb. (AP) — The Latest on Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholders meeting. Tens of thousands of people will fill an arena to listen to CEO Warren Buffett and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger talk business for more than five hours (all times local):\n2:20 p.m.\nWarren Buffett says he doesn't think 3G Capital has overdone its cost-cutting and layoffs at Heinz and Kraft Foods.\nBerkshire teamed up with the Brazilian investment firm 3G to buy Heinz and Kraft Foods.\nBuffett says he thinks 3G has been extremely intelligent in its cuts and hasn't eliminated things that will hurt sales volume.\nBuffett says all kinds of American companies are \"loaded with people not doing anything or doing the wrong thing.\"\n___\n1:15 p.m.\nWarren Buffett says he thinks Berkshire Hathaway's unusual culture will endure long after he is no longer leading the company.\nBuffett says Berkshire's board, managers and more than 350,000 employees will work to preserve the company's culture in the future.\nBerkshire trusts its managers to largely run their companies themselves with little oversight. Buffett always encourages employees to protect Berkshire's reputation and strengthen their brand.\nTo eventually replace the 85-year-old Buffett, Berkshire plans to split his job into three parts — chief executive officer, chairman and several investment managers. Buffett wants his son Howard, who already serves on the board, to become chairman after he is gone.\nBuffett, however, has indicated that he has no plans to retire, and he says he loves his work and remains in good health.\nBuffett has said previously that the company has several outstanding internal candidates for CEO, but he has refused to name them.\n___\n11:30 a.m.\nIn presidential politics, Buffett has long supported Democrat Hillary Clinton, so one shareholder asked what might happen to Berkshire if Republican Donald Trump were elected.\nBuffett says the effect on Berkshire won't be the main problem if Trump is elected. But he reassured shareholders that Berkshire would prosper regardless of who is elected.\nHe says U.S. businesses will continue to adapt and thrive, and no president will end that.\n___\n11:10 a.m.\nThe derivative contracts that big banks hold on their books can make them hard to evaluate, but Warren Buffett says he remains comfortable with Berkshire Hathaway's investments in Wells Fargo and Bank of America.\nBuffett says he still thinks derivatives can be dangerous in large quantities.\nBerkshire holds a portfolio of derivatives that act similar to insurance policies. Some of them cover whether certain stock market indexes will be lower years into the future. Others cover credit losses at groups of 100 companies, and some cover credit risks of individual companies.\nBuffett told shareholders Saturday that he won't ever agree to a contract that Berkshire couldn't easily pay if it needed to.\nMunger says the country would have fared better if banks had been prohibited from engaging in derivatives.\n___\n11:05 a.m.\nWarren Buffett doesn't think Coca-Cola's critics are write to blame the company's sugary beverages for obesity.\nBuffett's Berkshire Hathaway is Coca-Cola's largest shareholder, and Buffett says he gets about one-quarter of his calories from Coke products every day.\nBuffett says everyone has a choice about whether to consume more calories than they need, and it's not Coke's fault if they do.\nBuffett says he's probably happier because he's consumed so much Coke, fudge and peanut brittle in his life, and the 85-year-old remains in good health.\n___\n11 a.m.\nBillionaire Warren Buffett says one of the keys to successful investing is avoiding envy.\nBuffett told shareholders at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting Saturday that investors shouldn't envy someone who profited by buying shares in a company's initial public offering or claimed a lottery jackpot.\nBuffett says the key is to find look for investments that make sense to you and think of stocks as a slice of an individual business that you'd be comfortable to own for the long-term.\n___\n10:40 a.m.\nWarren Buffett defended NV Energy's role in a recent rate hike that regulators approved for rooftop solar customers.\nBuffett's Berkshire Hathaway owns the Nevada utility, so he was asked about the issue at Saturday's annual meeting.\nBuffett says people with rooftop solar power systems were allowed to sell power to the utility at prices roughly three times the market price.\nSupporters of renewable energy complained that the new rates will discourage solar power investments. But Buffett says the old rates had the effect of forcing other ratepayers to subsidize the small group of people who invested in solar systems.\n___\n9:35 a.m.\nBerkshire Hathaway's first-quarter profit grew 8 percent largely because of the way it had to account for its Duracell acquisition on paper, but revenue fell at its BNSF railroad and at its insurance units.\nCEO Warren Buffett offered a preview of the first-quarter results at the company's annual meeting Saturday although Berkshire won't release its full report until next Friday.\nBerkshire earned $5.589 billion, or about $3,400.89 per Class A share. That's up from $5.16 billion, or $3,143 per Class A share, last year.\nDuring the first quarter, Berkshire traded roughly $3.8 billion worth of Procter & Gamble stock for Duracell and about $1.7 billion cash. That boosted the paper value of Berkshire's investments and derivatives to $1.85 billion this year over $920 million last year.\nBerkshire also completed its $32 billion acquisition Precision Castparts during the quarter.\n___\n9:05 a.m.\nBerkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting again opened with a humorous movie filled with a mix of skits and ads for the company's products.\nOne of the bits in the movie showed Berkshire CEO campaigning to earn a spot in the Celebrity Apprentice show with Arnold Schwarzenegger.\nBut Buffett, who served as a financial adviser to Schwarzenegger when he ran for California governor, was outmaneuvered by Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger.\nSchwarzenegger picked Munger for the team after the 92-year-old's ruthless pitch that said \"Hire me if you want to live.\"\nThe video also showed Schwarzenegger pretending to practice variations on \"You're fired!\" such as \"You're terminated!\" to prepare for the show.\nBuffett and Munger will begin taking serious business questions Saturday morning and continue through the day.\n___\n7:25 a.m.\nA shareholder exclaimed \"There he is\" as he joined the throng of people surrounding Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett at the booth displaying aviation parts and other products made by Precision Castparts.\nBuffett was again surrounded by dozens of shareholders trying to get close enough to take a picture as he toured the exhibit hall at Berkshire's annual meeting. The 85-year-old investor is treated like a rock star at the event.\nUniversity of Arkansas student Fabio Rivera says he and some friends drove up to attend the meeting to hear Buffett talk.\nRivera says he wishes he had opportunities to see top business leaders like this in his home country of Honduras.\n___\n6:40 a.m.\nA group of environmentalists hopes to make an impression on Buffett and the audience when they urge shareholders to support drafting a report on climate change risks Berkshire Hathaway's insurance companies face.\nTim Rinne with the Nebraskans for Peace group that submitted the resolution says he knows the measure is likely to be defeated given that Buffett opposes it and he controls nearly one-third of the votes, but he hopes they can persuade Buffett to speak out about climate change.\nThe group brought in climate scientist Jim Hansen and Illinois State University professor and insurance expert Jim Jones to make their case at Saturday's meeting.\nBuffett said in his annual letter that the report isn't needed. He says it's reasonable to worry about climate change's effect on the world, but it shouldn't hurt insurance companies because policy prices are set annually based on that year's risks.\n___\n6:25 a.m.\nShareholders began to fill Omaha's downtown arena for Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting before 6:30 a.m. Saturday.\nThe company let the crowd in the Centurylink Center early Saturday, so people could get out of the steady rain and begin filtering through the metal detectors security set up for the first time this year.\nThey'll have to wait a couple hours for Berkshire CEO Warren Buffett and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger to begin answering questions. That's the day's main attraction.\nBut in the meantime, they can grab breakfast or start shopping at one of the booths selling products made by Berkshire Hathaway subsidiaries in the 200,000-square foot exhibit hall. See's Candy and Dairy Queen offer plenty for a sweet tooth while Fruit of the Loom, Geico insurance and Brooks running booths can serve more practical needs.\n___\n6:05 a.m.\nBerkshire Hathaway's peculiarities are on display again this weekend with tens of thousands of people filling an arena to listen to Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger talk business for hours at the conglomerate's annual meeting.\nThe Omaha event features an adjoining 200,000-square-foot exhibit hall where Berkshire subsidiaries such as See's Candy, Fruit of the Loom and Geico insurance sell their products as executives chat with shareholders.\nFor the first time, Saturday's meeting will be broadcast online on Yahoo Finance. The crowd may be smaller than last year's 50th anniversary meeting.\nBob Shanahan returned to for his second Berkshire meeting, so his son, Tim, would have a chance to attend the event while the 85-year-old Buffett and 92-year-old Munger are still leading the company.\n2016-04-30 19:32:24 GMT\nCopyright 2016.

  "articleText" : "Business News\nStruggling Morrisons pays out £3m to sacked boss Dalton Philips – with more to come\nThe former Morrisons boss has walked away with nearly £3m and could get a further £1.6m in payouts\nTuesday 28 April 2015 01:31 BST\nClick to follow\nThe Independent Online\nDalton Philips before he was ousted\nDalton Philips, the former Morrisons boss, has walked away from the supermarket with nearly £3m and could get a further £1.6m in payouts over the next two years, despite presiding over a collapse in the company’s profits, losing customers to discount rivals Aldi and Lidl and overseeing a tanking share price.\nMorrisons’ annual report, which was published last night, shows the ousted chief took home a salary of £850,000, a bonus of £1m and a £239,000 pension and benefits pot.\nAs part of his leaving package, after he was sacked by new chairman Andy Higginson in January, he also gets a year’s salary, a £24,000 car allowance and private healthcare, along with an iPad and iPhone, for another nine months.\nRead more\nAldi overtakes Waitrose as sixth biggest supermarket in the UK\nThe board decided Mr Philips should be considered a “good leaver”, meaning he is also entitled to long-term share incentives despite leaving the company, which would give him a maximum of 550,999 free shares next year, worth £1.1m on last night’s closing share price, and another 269,696 the following year – worth £520,000.\nThe payout will no doubt anger shareholders, who heard Mr Philips’s strategy described as “bullshit” by Sir Ken Morrison at the company’s annual general meeting last year.\nWhen Mr Philips joined the UK’s fourth biggest supermarket, replacing Marc Bolland, shares were at 300p each and on the day he was sacked they were 176.9p. Last night they closed down 0.8p at 193.3p.\nSince he was replaced by David Potts in February, the company has changed the way it calculated its bonuses. Previously, the underlying pre-tax profit targets accounted for 60 per cent of the payout, but now they will only account for 50 per cent.\nThe report also reveals Mr Higginson will be paid £400,000 a year for his role as chairman – an above inflation pay rise of 6 per cent compared with his predecessor Ian Gibson, although the former chairman took home £463,000, which included three months’ pay in lieu of notice.\n",

  "articleText" : "Government to sell remaining 14% stake in Royal Mail\nBankers report solid demand for shares in delivery firm, mainly from domestic and US institutional investors\nRoyal Mail shares are trading at about 471p, valuing the company at approximately £4.7bn. Photograph: PA\nMonday 12 October 2015 18.51 BST\nLast modified on Tuesday 19 July 2016 14.06 BST\nClose\nThis article is 1 year old\nThe government has continued selling assets it no longer considers should be held in the public sector with the £591m disposal of the remaining shares it owns in Royal Mail .\nBankers were hopeful of selling the shares, which represented a 14% stake in the company, for less than a 5% discount on the Royal Mail’s share price on Monday at around 455p.\nRoyal Mail shares are trading at about 471p, which values the company at approximately £4.7bn. In June, the government sold about 50% of its then existing stake, amounting to approximately 15% of the company, at 500p per share raising £750m.\nThree US-owned banks handled the sale on behalf of the government for zero fees. The banks say they do such deals for the government for prestige reasons and to build up their franchises. Barclays, the UK bank most likely to be able to handle a deal like this, was not included.\nThe original sale of the first 60% of shares in Royal Mail was heavily criticised when bankers priced the shares at 330p, only to see them rise to nearly 618p. Critics said the taxpayer had lost about £1bn on the sale.\nBankers on the deal on Monday night reported solid demand, mainly from domestic and US institutional investors, even though the FTSE 100 closed down 0.7%. No shares are being sold directly to private investors.\nA Department for Business spokesperson said: “The universal postal service is strongly protected by law and Ofcom has a duty to ensure its provision. Therefore the government sees no policy reason to retain a stake in Royal Mail.”\nThe sale of shares in Royal Mail is part of a privatisation programme outlined by George Osborne at the time of the budget in July. The chancellor said at the time the government aimed to raise about £32bn in the current financial year from major asset sales. So far there have been sales of shares in RBS and Lloyds Bank and two sell-offs of stakes in Royal Mail.\nThe government also plans to sell a £13bn portfolio of Northern Rock mortgage assets and, more problematically perhaps, a chunk of the student loan book. The sale of these types of assets is most likely to appeal to other financial institutions or trade buyers. There are suggestions that three consortia had bid for the Northern Rock assets, known as Granite, by the October 9 deadline.\nOther assets, such as Channel 4 or Ordnance Survey, are also possibilities for disposal.\n“The government is committed to ensuring the effective and efficient management of publicly owned assets, including assessing options for disposal,” a Treasury spokesman said. “Where there is no longer a strong policy reason for continued public ownership, or where there is potential for an asset to operate more sensibly and efficiently in the private sector, the government will continue to look into the potential sale of public sector assets.”\n• This article was amended on 15 October 2015. An earlier version referred to the “£700m disposal of the remaining shares it owns in Royal Mail”. This has been corrected.\n",

Montross, in contrast, reports to Buffett.\nThe change adds to the duties of Jain, 64, who has expanded the Berkshire reinsurance unit he oversees, Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, even as General Re has curbed underwriting amid increased competition.\nMontross' retirement was previously reported by The Insurance Insider.\nGeneral Re was beset by underwriting problems for years after Buffett bought it in 1998 for roughly $16 billion.\nIt has performed better in recent years, and Buffett said in his annual shareholder letter in February it was now a \"gem.\"\nReinsurers provide protection for traditional insurers.\nBerkshire owns some 90 businesses including energy companies, food and clothing companies, and a railroad, and well over $100 billion in common stocks.\nIt generates power to invest and make acquisitions from \"float,\" or the amount of insurance premiums collected before claims are paid.\nGeneral Re contributed $18.6 billion of float to Berkshire's overall $87.7 billion total as of year end, while Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance contributed $44.1 billion. A majority of the remainder came from the auto insurer Geico.\nBuffett's successor as Berkshire's CEO remains a mystery, though the 85-year-old has said the board of his Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate has internal candidates.\nInvestors also widely consider Greg Abel, 53, a potential successor. He leads the company's Berkshire Hathaway Energy unit, and last July joined the board of Kraft Heinz Co, the food company in which Berkshire owns a 26.8 percent stake.\nIn his own letter to Berkshire shareholders last year, Vice Chairman Charlie Munger called Jain and Abel \"world-leading.\"\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Andrew Hay)\nNext In Big Story 10\n",

The timing of the approach, after more than a decade of acquisitions by AB InBev, follows a roughly 15 percent drop in SABMiller's share price since August.\n\"It's exactly the moment they've been waiting for,\" said Morningstar analyst Phil Gorham. \"It makes sense financially for the first time in years.\"\nAB InBev will have to pay at least 40 pounds ($62) per SAB Miller share, and maybe as much as 45 pounds, according to analysts - implying an overall price of up to $130 billion, including SABMiller's debt.\nThat would make it the biggest M&A deal of 2015, already shaping up to be a record year since the 2008 financial crisis in terms of deal volume, and one the five largest takeovers since 1980.\nShares in SAB closed up 19.9 percent at 36.14 pounds, giving it a market capitalization of $90 billion. AB InBev's were up 6.4 percent. Rivals Heineken, Carlsberg and Diageo also rose on speculation SAB might seek another merger as a defence strategy, as it did last year when it offered to buy Heineken, but was rebuffed.\nSince then it has combined its African soft drink bottler with that of Coca-Cola, and in recent weeks there has been speculation about it combining with Diageo or Australian drinks firm Coca-Cola Amatil.\nThe global beer market share of AB InBev, maker of Budweiser, Stella Artois and Corona, was 21.1 percent in 2014, while SABMiller's was 15 percent, according to industry experts Plato Logic. Heineken is the No. 3.\nROOM FOR FUNDING\nAB InBev's target for its net debt to core profit (EBITDA) ratio is 2 times, from around 2.5 currently. It is likely to reach that by 2016, the earliest any deal could realistically be completed, and so has room to borrow to fund any takeover.\nWhen it bought Budweiser-maker Anheuser-Busch in 2008 for $52 billion, the largest cash takeover in history at the time, it let the ratio rise to beyond 5 times. Going that high again might allow it to raise as much as $100 billion in debt.\nAB InBev's controlling families own just over half of the company, while SABMiller's two top shareholders are cigarette maker Altria and the Santo Domingo family of Colombia.\nAltria on Wednesday declined comment on the AB InBev approach, but on Sept. 9, its CFO Billy Gifford said at an analyst conference that it regularly evaluates its SABMiller investment \"and at this time we believe maintaining the asset is in our shareholders' best interests.\"\nThe Santo Domingo family could not immediately be reached for comment.\nNeil Dwane, European chief investment officer, equity, at Allianz Global Investors, which holds shares in both companies, said AB InBev had faced increasing pressure to return excess cash to shareholders.\n\"ABI is paying a high price but accretion to earnings from low debt costs would be something in the region of 15 percent. However, we think the return on this deal could be a relatively disappointing 8 percent after 10 years,\" Dwane said.\nThere are significant antitrust hurdles to any combination, particularly in the United States, where the companies would have about 70 percent of the beer market.\n\"The costs that could be saved in the distribution operations are high - and the antitrust hurdles are higher,\" said Erik Gordon, professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business.\nA deal would allow Molson Coors to acquire the 58 percent of the joint venture owned by SABMiller according to the operating agreement that governs it. A change in control at SABMiller would automatically give Molson the right to acquire an additional 8 percent and name a new CEO at the venture. Denver-based Molson would also have the right of first and last offer for the remaining 50 percent stake.\nA Molson spokesman declined to comment on whether the company would be interested in a bid, but Molson shares surged more than 12 percent to an all-time high.\nAny merged group may also have to sell interests in China, where SABMiller's CR Snow joint venture with China Resources  is the market leader. Heineken, Carlsberg or China's Tsingtao could be potential buyers.\nPlato estimates that after disposals, the combined group could end up with a 28 percent global market share.\nAB InBev is being advised by Lazard, while SABMiller is being advised by Robey Warshaw, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley.\n($1 = 0.6486 pounds)\n(Additional reporting by Kate Holton, Alasdair Pal, Freya Berry, Sinead Cruise, Anjali Athavaley, Jilian Mincer and Emiliano Mellino; Writing by Christian Plumb; Editing by Pravin Char, Elaine Hardcastle and Alan Crosby)\nNext In Hot Stocks\n",

  "articleText" : "Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp\nOld Mutual Plc, the London-based insurer, said first-quarter sales gained 18 percent as revenue from operations in Africa jumped by a third.\nGross sales increased to 7.3 billion pounds ($11.5 billion), from 6.3 billion pounds a year earlier, Old Mutual said in a statement Thursday. Sales in emerging markets surged 20 percent to 2.7 billion pounds, while funds under management increased 10 percent to 351.4 billion pounds.\nThe overall sales figure beat consensus estimates provided by Old Mutual, while new life assurance business was better than expected, Eamonn Flanagan, an analyst at Shore Capital Group Ltd. in London who has a hold rating on the stock of Africa’s largest insurer, said in a note to clients. Total funds under management were in line with estimates, he said.\nOld Mutual, founded in Cape Town more than 150 years ago, has operations in Africa, the U.S., the U.K., Europe, Latin America and China. It has focused on African expansion in the past two years as growth from that continent outpaces developed markets. Roberts is due to leave before year-end, to be succeeded by Standard Bank Group Ltd.’s Bruce Hemphill.\nOld Mutual rose as much as 1.4 percent in Johannesburg before paring gains to trade 0.9 percent higher at 42.76 rand as of 10:38 a.m.\nNet client cash flows improved to 500 million pounds in the first quarter from a decline last year, Old Mutual said. This result was “much lower than market expectations, albeit better than the negative figure” a year earlier, Shore Capital’s Flanagan said.\n‘Good Start’\n“This has been a very good start to the year, with all of our businesses performing well with continued strategic progress,” Old Mutual Chief Executive Officer Julian Roberts said. Banking unit Nedbank Group Ltd. in South Africa “has had another excellent quarter with good growth in non-interest revenue. Gross sales elsewhere in Africa grew by 34 percent,” he said.\nNet outflows of 100 million pounds from Old Mutual Asset Management were caused by sector rotation as investors adjusted their allocations, Ingrid Johnson, the insurer’s financial director, said by phone from London. There were inflows into funds such as emerging-market equities while others, like U.S. value funds, experienced outflows, she said.\nThrough its purchase of microfinance company Faulu Kenya DTM Ltd. and a controlling stake in Kenya’s UAP Holdings Ltd., Old Mutual has strengthened its presence in East and central Africa.\nIn West Africa it is partnering with Ecobank Transnational Inc., 20 percent-owned by Nedbank. Having spent 3.6 billion rand ($303 million) of the 5 billion rand earmarked for African expansion, this year may be more about consolidation and integration than acquisitions, Johnson said.\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Prudential set out medium-term targets in 2013, focusing on growth in its Asian business, which currently contributes a third of the company's operating profit. Prudential is also listed in Asia.\nAhead of closely-fought British elections on Thursday, Thiam said a British exit from the European Union would be harmful for the country's economy.\n\"Is the EU perfect? No ... the benefits for the UK of being in the EU outweigh the disadvantages in the long term.\"\nBritain's Conservative party, which is neck-and-neck in the polls with Labour, has promised to hold a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU if it is elected.\nMIXED RESULTS\nIn the United States, new business profit at Prudential's Jackson business fell 28 percent to 153 million pounds.\nUK retail new business profit dropped 11 percent to 34 million pounds, and Prudential wrote no new bulk annuity business in the quarter.\nInsurers have been looking to bulk annuities, which transfer the risk of defined benefit -- or final salary -- pension schemes, from companies to insurers, to make up for a shortfall in individual annuity sales following recent UK pension reform.\nAsian new business profit rose 22 percent, however, to 309 million pounds, and the Asian asset management arm saw third party net inflows of 2.3 billion pounds, up 106 percent.\nJP Morgan analysts said the overall new business profit figure beat its expectations and \"flags strong Asian growth\".\nM&G, the group's UK investment arm, saw net inflows of 700 million pounds, down from 1.4 billion the previous year. But the fund manager's external assets under management rose 8 percent to 139.5 billion pounds.\nPrudential's shares were down 0.6 percent at 1,603 pence at 1146 GMT, underperforming rival Legal & General, which rose 1.1 percent after the company announced record cash generation in the first quarter.\n($1 = 0.6590 pounds)   (Editing by Ruth Pitchford and Mark Potter)\nNext In Company Results\n",

REUTERS/Toby Melville\n1/3\nleft\nright\nBen van Beurden (L), chief executive officer of Royal Dutch Shell, shakes hand with Andrew Gould, chairman of the BG Group, during a news conference at the London Stock Exchange, April 8, 2015. REUTERS/Stefan Wermuth\n2/3\nleft\nright\nShell's company logo is pictured at a gas station in Zurich April 8, 2015. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann\n3/3\nBy Dmitry Zhdannikov and Karolin Schaps | LONDON\nLONDON Royal Dutch Shell agreed to buy smaller rival BG Group for 47 billion pounds ($70 billion) in the first major energy industry merger in more than a decade, closing the gap on market leader U.S. Exxon Mobil after a plunge in prices.\nAnglo-Dutch Shell will pay a mix of cash and shares that  values each BG share at around 1,350 pence, the companies said. This is a hefty premium of around 52 percent to the 90-day trading average for BG, setting the bar high for any potential counter-bid by a company such as Exxon, which has said it would also use the downturn in oil markets to expand.\nThe third-biggest oil and gas deal ever by enterprise value will bring Shell assets in Brazil, East Africa, Australia, Kazakhstan and Egypt. BG has some of the world's most ambitious projects in liquefied natural gas (LNG), where demand is growing as consumers turn away from more polluting fuels such as coal.\nShell is already the world's leading LNG company and it would get BG's capacity in LNG logistics - complex infrastructure that includes terminals, pipelines, specialised tankers, rigs, super coolers, regasification facilities and storage points.\n\"We are seeing a gasification of energy demand. Shell clearly recognise this,\" said Richard Gorry, director at JBC Energy Asia. \"That said, Shell is still taking a big gamble because if the price of oil and gas doesn't go back up (in the next 24 months), I would imagine this might put them in a difficult position in terms of cash flow.\"\nBOOST TO RESERVES\nShell said on Wednesday the deal would boost its proven oil and gas reserves by 25 percent.\nStitched together by Shell CEO Ben van Beurden and BG Chairman Andrew Gould, the tie-up follows a halving of oil prices since last June, putting a premium on access to proven assets rather than costly exploration. Record low interest rates have made it easy to raise cheap funding for big deals.\n\"We have been scanning quite a few opportunities, with BG always being at the top of the list of the prospects to combine with,\" Van Beurden told a conference call. \"We have two very strong portfolios combining globally in deep water and integrated gas\".\nBritain's BG had a market capitalisation of $46 billion at Tuesday's close, Shell was worth $202 billion and Exxon, the world's largest energy company by market value, was worth $360 billion.\nBG's bonds traded up strongly on the deal and its shares closed up 27 percent at 1206 pence. Shell shares fell 5 percent to 1982.5 pence. They were the most traded stocks across Europe on Wednesday, with $1.6 billion of BG shares changing hands and $3 billion of Royal Dutch Shell shares.\nBG stock has tumbled nearly 28 percent since mid-June, when the slump in global oil prices began. The agreed price is around 20 percent above BG's share price of a year ago.\n\"In buying BG, Shell is making a bold strategic bet that oil prices will recover towards the $70-90 level in the medium term,\" said Henderson Global Investors. Brent crude was trading below $57 a barrel on Wednesday.\nBarclays bank said Shell would have to persuade its shareholders that it can control capital spending at the new company and show BG's portfolio can deliver the promised growth options beyond Brazil, \"something that, in our view, has been far from evident of late\".\nOne source close to the deal said a counterbid was unlikely. The source said a U.S. company such as Exxon may be doubly wary of getting into a takeover battle after the failure of drugmaker Pfizer's attempted takeover of AstraZeneca last year.\nThe deal represents a windfall for Shell's adviser Bank of America Merrill Lynch. BG's advisers are Goldman Sachs and the smaller Robey Warshaw.\nBAML has underwritten a 3.025-billion-pound bridge loan that will be syndicated to other banks and is expected to be taken out by a capital markets raising, according to the offer documents.\nOIL PRICE IMPACT\nWith BG, Shell would be the leading foreign oil company in Brazil. Analysts at investment bank Jefferies said they now expected Shell to surpass Exxon as the world's largest publicly traded oil and gas producer by 2018, with output of 4.2 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.\nGlobal LNG production was 246 million tonnes last year. The new Shell-BG group would have 18 percent of world output.\nVan Beurden said the presence of two large players in Australia, Brazil and China and the European Union might require a detailed conversation with anti-trust authorities, but was unlikely to lead to forced asset sales.\nThe halving in crude prices has created an environment similar to the turn of the millennium, when large mergers reshaped the industry. Back then, BP acquired rivals Amoco and Arco, Exxon bought Mobil and Chevron merged with Texaco.\n\"A deal of this size would certainly be getting everyone interested in running the ruler over potential combinations in the natural resources sector,\" said Paul Gait, an analyst at Bernstein Research.\nBut some industry watchers were reluctant to predict another flurry of mega-deals, saying many oil majors cannot afford to put stretched balance sheets under further pressure.\n\"If you're looking to the next big deal, Exxon Mobil stands out as most likely to pull the trigger,\" said Wood Mackenzie. \"But don't expect a wave of late '90s-style consolidation.\"\nShell has long been seen as a potential buyer thanks to its healthy cash flow and relatively low oil price breakeven.\nThe deal, which should generate pretax synergies of around 2.5 billion pounds per year, will result in BG shareholders owning around 19 percent of the combined group.\nLast year, BG Chairman Gould hired CEO Helge Lund from Norway's Statoil to turn around the company. Gould said on Wednesday Lund would remain the CEO through the transition.\nHowever, it was evident the deal was driven by Van Beurden, who took over as the CEO last year, and Gould, a veteran executive who previously ran oil services giant Schlumberger.\n\"I called Andrew up and we had a very good and constructive discussion about the idea and it very quickly seemed to make sense to both of us,\" Van Beurden told a conference call. \"What has happened in the last month, apart from it being a logical deal, it has also become a very compelling deal from a value perspective,\"\n(This version of the story has been refiled to fix name of Exxon Mobil)\n(Reporting by Narottam Medhora and Sai Sachin R in Bengaluru; additional reporting by Greg Roumeliotis and Denny Thomas, Henning Gloystein, Karolin Schaps, Kate Holton, Chris Mangham, Freya Berry, Silvia Antonioli and Vikram Subhedar; writing by Denny Thomas and Tom Pfeiffer; editing by Keith Weir and David Stamp)\nNext In Global Energy News\nShell CEO expects no valuation hit from climate accord\nAMSTERDAM Royal Dutch Shell  expects to pump out all the fossil fuel reserves listed on its balance sheet, its chief executive said, dismissing concerns that production limits in the wake of the Paris climate accord could hit the energy giant's valuation.\n",

REUTERS/Luke MacGregor\nBy Ben Hirschler | LONDON\nLONDON An experimental heart drug from GlaxoSmithKline failed to work as hoped in the first part of a large clinical trial, the company said on Tuesday, dealing a blow to its pipeline of new medicines.\nLosmapimod was being assessed as a treatment to reduce the risk of further cardiovascular problems after heart attacks, but it failed to show the hoped-for benefits and GSK said the result did not support investment in a larger second part of the study.\nAnalysts had viewed the drug, a so-called p38 kinase inhibitor, as a relatively high-risk project. GSK said it would assess the findings over the next few months and evaluate all options for future development.\nThe setback was offset by better news of the company's experimental shingles vaccine Shingrix, which succeeded in a second pivotal study, confirming its status as one of the more promising products in GSK's pipeline.\nThe vaccine demonstrated 90 percent efficacy in preventing the disease in people over 70 years old and GSK said it planned to submit it for regulatory approval in the second half of 2016.\nConsensus forecasts currently point to Shingrix annual sales of $595 million by 2020, according to Thomson Reuters Cortellis, while Goldman Sachs believes it has the potential to achieve peak sales of 1 billion pounds ($1.5 billion).\nIn contrast to Merck's established Zostavax, currently the only shingles vaccine on the market, GSK's product shows no diminution in efficacy with age. Zostavax is less effective among people who are 70 years or older, which is an age group often at risk from shingles.\nGSK's vaccine contains a component from U.S. biotech firm Agenus, which is entitled to royalties on future sales.\nThe British drugmaker gave the updates on losmapimod and Shingrix in separate announcements, one day before it is due to report third-quarter financial results and a week before it will give a detailed pipeline update on Nov. 3.\nIt is the first time in a decade that the company has hosted such a research and development day for investors and CEO  Andrew Witty is expected to use the opportunity to try to show that GSK remains a powerhouse for developing new medicines.\n(Editing by David Goodman)\n",

Talks are at an early stage, no final decision has been made on the timing or size of the bid, and ICE could still decide against an offer, they said.\nDeutsche Boerse and LSE on Feb. 23\nannounced talks to combine and create a global player worth at least 20 billion pounds ($28 billion), which could better compete with ICE as well as CME Group Inc., the world’s largest derivatives market. A formal proposal from ICE or Deutsche Boerse could spark a bidding war between the suitors, which each have until late March to make an official offer for the bourse under the U.K.’s takeover rules.\nDeutsche Boerse is likely to announce the details of a merger plan with LSE as early as next week, according to a different person familiar with the matter. ICE, which sees the potential to generate more cost savings with LSE than Deutsche Boerse, is likely to wait until after the Germans bid, one of the people said.\nCME Group is also working with advisers to assess whether it could challenge the deal, people familiar with the matter said last week.\nRepresentatives for ICE and LSE declined to comment. An official for Deutsche Boerse didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.\nLSE’s shares were little changed at 2,837 pence at 9:06 a.m. in London. The stock soared to a record 2,893 pence on March 3. Deutsche Boerse was also little changed today at 75.10 euros.\nAs ICE hashes out its strategy, options under review include shifting its legal address to the U.K. to take advantage of lower tax rates, separate people familiar with the matter said. Because of the cost savings associated with such a move -- known as a tax inversion -- ICE would then have more flexibility to make a higher offer, said the people, who asked not to be identified because talks are private.\nWhile the Atlanta-based company is discussing the feasibility of the step, ICE isn’t currently planning an inversion and may decide against it, the people said. The potential political pushback in the U.S., especially during an election year, is one reason it may choose not to pursue the tax-saving deal, the people said. \nICE also owns the U.S.’s best-known bourse, the New York Stock Exchange, which could make a move abroad to cut taxes particularly controversial.\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

As well as bringing together the classic U.S. favorites, the merger would also see AB InBev's Stella Artois and SABMiller's Grolsch in the same stable.\nAnd it would allow AB InBev to venture out more into the African and Australian markets where its might is yet to be felt like it is in Europe, North Africa and Asia.\nIn the event of a deal, the sheer size of the combined company is expected to push regulators to require the sale of some brands to ensure fair competition.

While the merger would complete Shireâ€™s transformation from a specialist in drugs for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder into a major producer of rare disease treatments, investors and analysts remain concerned about Baxaltaâ€™s dependence on its haemophilia business.\nShireâ€™s share price slumped 8.23 percent in yesterdayâ€™s session, having jumped over two percent immediately after the deal was announced. This morning, the stock has slipped further into the red, having shed 0.94 percent to 3,888.00p as of 08:01 GMT. Shares in Baxalta were also under pressure, and shed 2.27 percent to close at $39.10 in New York.\nThe London-listed rare disease specialist, which first approached Baxalta with an all-share offer over the summer, won over the US maker of treatments for rare blood conditions, cancers and immune system disorders, after sweetening the bid with a cash component. Shire will pay $45.57 a share for Baxalta, including $18 in cash. The price represents a 37.5-percent premium over the US companyâ€™s stock price before the initial bid was made public in August, weeks after Baxalta was spun off from US medical group Baxter.\nShire said yesterday that the deal is expected to yield annual operating cost synergies of over $500 million, and drive growth to over $20 billion in anticipated annual revenues by the end of the decade. Despite the upbeat forecasts, the tie-up has failed to spark enthusiasm among investors and analysts.\nâ€œA lot of people donâ€™t like the dealâ€� largely due to its dependence on Baxaltaâ€™s haemophilia franchise, John Boris, analyst with Suntrust Robinson Humphrey, told Reuters. The newswire also quoted analysts at UBS as cautioning that Baxalta could actually dilute Shire earnings from 2019 to 2023 before being accretive again from 2024.\nShireâ€™s chief executive Flemming Ornskov, however, is upbeat on the enlarged groupâ€™s prospects.\nâ€œThis was not a deal just for the sake of size,â€� the Dane told the Financial Times yesterday.  â€œWe want a leadership position in rare diseases, which we consider to be one of the most, if not the most, attractive segments of the pharmaceuticals market.â€�\nRare disease medicines, or orphan drugs as they are sometimes called, are a lucrative segment on account of their typically high prices and margins. Rare disease specialists also benefit from regulatory incentives such as fast-track approvals and longer periods of market exclusivity intended to encourage research and investment in the field.\n",

  "articleText" : "Citigroup to Sell OneMain to Springleaf for $4.25 Billion\nDakin Campbell and Matthew Monks\nMarch 3, 2015 — 7:01 AM EST\nUpdated on\nShare on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp\nCitigroup Inc. agreed to sell its 103-year-old subprime lender OneMain Financial to Springleaf Holdings Inc. for $4.25 billion in cash, taking another step away from the business model championed by Sandy Weill.\nSpringleaf, majority owned by Fortress Investment Group LLC, plans to complete the acquisition in the third quarter, the Evansville, Indiana-based company said Tuesday in a statement. Citigroup said the sale will add about $1 billion to pretax earnings, and Springleaf expects the deal to boost 2015 net income, excluding one-time charges tied to the purchase.\nCitigroup is jettisoning a consumer lender founded in 1912 as Commercial Credit that Weill used as a building block to create the world’s largest financial supermarket. Chief Executive Officer Michael Corbat has continued to dismantle it, picking up where predecessor Vikram Pandit left off. The firm has sold more than 60 businesses and $700 billion of assets, including insurance and retail-brokerage units that Weill once deemed essential.\n“Today’s announcement is a significant milestone in the simplification of our company,” Corbat, 54, said in the statement. “While this business didn’t fit our strategy, it serves customers who deserve and need credit.”\nInstallment Loans\nSpringleaf and Baltimore-based OneMain are two of the biggest U.S. providers of installment loans, a type of high-interest credit. OneMain lends money for purposes including auto repairs and remodeling kitchens. The combined company will have 1,967 branches in 43 states, and Springleaf expects to close about 200 branches beginning next year, according to its statement.\n“We look forward to welcoming OneMain’s talented team members as we build on our mutual success to enhance the growth potential of the combined company,” Springleaf CEO Jay Levine said in his firm’s statement.\nPandit tagged OneMain for sale in 2009 after the parent company took the largest U.S. bank bailout. He rebranded the unit in December 2010 and started an auction process in 2011 that later broke off without a deal. New York-based Citigroup said in May 2014 that it was once again pursuing exit options.\nCitigroup had been seeking at least $4 billion for OneMain, people familiar with the matter have said, and also had filed to hold an initial public offering for the unit, pursuing a dual-track process to get the best price. Citigroup’s portfolio of unwanted assets will break even or be profitable for a second consecutive year in 2015, Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach said Monday.\nOneMain Brand\nLevine will run the combined company, and Mary McDowell will continue as OneMain’s CEO. The firm expects to migrate to the OneMain brand beginning in mid-2016 and it will be run from Connecticut, according to Springleaf.\nFortress is a private-equity and hedge-fund manager. The firm pushed into consumer lending with a 2010 deal to buy a majority stake in American General Finance from American International Group Inc., the insurer that was divesting assets to repay a U.S. bailout. The operation was rebranded as Springleaf.\nOneMain had $3.34 billion in shareholder’s equity and $9.72 billion in assets at the end of September, according to a filing issued as part of its proposed IPO. The firm generated $415 million in profit on $1.67 billion in revenue in the first nine months of 2014. Springleaf earned about $552 million during the same period, it reported in November.\nCitigroup is acting as its own adviser on the deal. Bank of America Corp., Barclays Plc, Credit Suisse Group AG and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. advised Springleaf.\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal. LEARN MORE\n",

  "articleText" : "Environment | Sun Apr 19, 2015 | 2:17pm EDT\nFive years after BP oil spill, some Gulf oystermen are losing hope\nBy Jonathan Kaminsky | NEW ORLEANS\nNEW ORLEANS Five years after the largest oil spill in U.S. history spewed millions of gallons of crude into the Gulf of Mexico, many Louisiana oystermen are fearful that a once-bountiful population of the mollusks may never recover.\n\"My kids are losing hope,\" said Wilbert Collins, 77, a retired third-generation oysterman in southeastern Louisiana with four sons who followed him into the industry. The family business has endured a 60 percent drop in yields in the past five years.\nThe explosion and collapse of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig on April 20, 2010, left 11 workers dead and huge stretches of the Gulf fouled with petroleum that gushed from the site for 87 days.\nThe accident has cost BP, the London-based oil major that owned the well, $42 billion in fines, cleanup and compensation costs. A judge is set to rule at any time on additional federal Clean Water Act penalties of up to $13.7 billion.\nThe spill, which killed thousands of birds and hundreds of turtles while prompting temporary fishing bans, also has led to new rules intended to make the offshore oil and gas industry safer, despite its inherent dangers.\nBP has characterized its impact on marine life as unfortunate but not catastrophic. But oyster populations in the waters off southeastern Louisiana have been particularly slow to recover.\nThe yield in the Lake Pontchartrain Basin, once the engine of the largest oyster industry in the United States, plummeted by more than two-thirds from 2009 to 2013, the latest year for which state data are available.\nState data show that in 2009, the oyster harvest in the Lake Pontchartrain Basin fetched about $29 million, which dropped to $12 million in 2013, the latter figure buoyed by higher oyster prices.\nThe decline began after the spill, but its cause is unclear. Scientists are studying possible culprits including the oil itself, overfishing and the large volume of fresh water released into the brackish areas where oysters live, part of an effort to flush crude off the coast.\nCiting government studies, BP has said the drop in oyster populations does not appear to have been caused by the spill.\nNew regulations were announced last week to tighten safety requirements on offshore drilling equipment. U.S. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell said in a statement proposed regulations built on lessons learned from the BP spill.\nThe American Petroleum Institute said it was reviewing the proposal, the third set of drilling-equipment rules put out by the Obama administration.\nThose safeguards are little comfort to Collins, who said he can only hope that oyster larvae will soon return to the waters he has worked for more than 60 years.\n\"I've never seen it so bad,\" he said. \"If it keeps on going down, I don't know what we're going to do.\"\n(Reporting by Jonathan Kaminsky; editing by Clelia Oziel)\nOil from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill swirls in various colours in shallow water on East Grand Terre Island, Louisiana June 8, 2010.

That includes a reduction in the pension deficit to 2.6 billion pounds from 3.9 billion pounds at February 2015.\nPositive Ground\nTesco has announced the first increase in U.K. same store sales growth for three years\nSource: Bloomberg Intelligence\nClearly Tesco has stabilized compared with a year ago, when it was still reeling from the worst crisis in its almost 100-year history after the previous management overstated profits.\nWhere Lewis is making less progress is translating that sales recovery into higher profits.\nTrue, Tesco bounced back into the black at a pre-tax level, after taking into account exceptional items. That's mainly because of stonking 6.7 billion pounds of write-downs and charges last time -- arguably a kitchen sinking that rebased profit to Lewis's benefit.\nIt also met forecasts of operating profit before exceptional items, delivering the promised 944 million pounds in the year to February. But Lewis won't be drawn on how far and fast profits will grow from here.\nHe needs to keep cutting prices to maintain the sales momentum, and that's expensive. While the \"aspiration\" is to improve profitability, he acknowledges this won’t happen in a smooth line. He reckons that to meet the 1.25 billion pound consensus for the year to February 2017, and continue to invest, would be a pretty big ask.\nThe shares fell as much as 5 percent on the cautious guidance. Still, they are up about 25 percent since the start of the year. They trade on a forward ratio of price to earnings of 21 times, against 17 times for the European sector.\nEquity investors clearly believe the Tesco juggernaut is finally turning. Bond investors less so.\nAs the chart below shows, the spread to government bonds has widened over the past month, underperforming the broader European high yield index.\nWrong Direction\nTesco bond spreads widened in the past month, while the broader market gained ground\nSource: Bloomberg\nNormalized spread performance\nBondholders may have already figured out that sales growth wasn't going to feed into profits anytime soon, and will want more evidence that the reduction in debt will continue. Clearly the company's cash cushion has improved: it generated 1.3 billion pounds of free cashflow in the year to February, compared with a 1.34 billion pound outflow a year earlier.\nBut the credit ratings are languishing below investment grade. They were pushed down to junk levels at the start of last year, and it's a fair question to ask whether the company's focused on quickly exiting that status. Tesco has more than 1 billion pounds of bonds coming due in each of 2016 and 2017, and a few more hefty maturities in the years after that. \nRefinancing Needed\nTesco may be wise to use cash coming in to pay off debt coming due\nSource: Bloomberg\nThe shares are now approaching the point where a multi-billion pound rights issue would be possible. Lewis seems to have chosen instead to trade through the debt pile.\nHe's still got a few big items to drop in his shopping cart.

  "articleText" : "Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp\nTeva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., whose unsolicited $40.1 billion offer to buy Mylan NV was rejected this week, said first-quarter profit rose 11 percent on lower costs and a new generic copy of an AstraZeneca Plc drug.\nProfit excluding some costs rose to $1.17 billion, or $1.36 a share, from $1.05 billion, or $1.23, a year earlier, the Petach Tikva, Israel-based company said in a statement today. Analysts predicted $1.25, the average of 18 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The company raised its profit forecast for the year.\nChief Executive Officer Erez Vigodman rattled the pharmaceutical industry last week with the Mylan bid, which would create a giant in generics with more than $27 billion in sales. With Teva’s best-selling product, the multiple-sclerosis drug Copaxone, losing patent protection this year, Vigodman has accelerated cost reductions as he looks for deals to replace the revenue Teva may lose.\nMylan rejected the offer, saying it’s too low and the companies have conflicting cultures. The purchase would immediately boost Teva’s generics division, which had a sales drop in the second half of last year and has lost U.S. market share to lower-cost manufacturers.\nSales fell 0.4 percent to $4.98 billion, above the average analyst estimate of $4.81 billion. Revenue from generic drugs increased 9 percent to $2.6 billion, aided by sales of its copy of Nexium, the AstraZeneca antacid treatment. Teva in January received approval to market a generic version of the drug.\nRevenue from Copaxone decreased 14 percent in the quarter to $924 million.\nEven so, the Israeli company delivered “strong organic growth through solidifying its base business,” David Maris, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets in New York, wrote in a note. “This was a good quarter for Teva.”\nCheaper Generics\nBesides the potential of cheaper generics, Copaxone, an injection that brings in about half of Teva’s profits, faces competition from newer oral drugs. To hold on to its market share, Teva has converted 67 percent of U.S. patients to the patented, three-times-a-week formulation that it introduced in the first quarter last year.\nThe company’s American depositary receipts fell 2.3 percent to $60.64 at 11:24 a.m. in New York. They have returned 8.6 percent including dividends this year as of yesterday’s close, trailing the 21 percent return for the Bloomberg Europe Pharmaceutical Index.\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

  "articleText" : "December 21, 2015 06:23 GMT\nSainsbury’s shares have outperformed Morrisons, rising 8.6% over the past yearReuters\nSir Ken Morrison, the former chairman of the fourth largest UK supermarket chain, Morrisons, and his son William, together have acquired stake in their company's peer Sainsbury's, over time. The 4.7 million shares that they hold together translate to a combined value of £11.9m (€16.3m, $17.7m).\nWhile the former chairman holds 2.6 million shares worth £6m and has given Mike Coupe, the chief executive at Sainsbury's his public backing, William Morrison Junior owns the remaining, according to The Times.\nAccording to filings, Sir Ken purchased his stake around April last year when Sainsbury's was trading at about 300p. Sainsbury's shares have outperformed Morrisons, rising 8.6% over the past year. The stock closed at 255p on Friday (18 December).\n\"It is a well-run company,\" the 84-year-old retailer said. However, he refused to comment when queried if he had purchased the shares of any other supermarket peer, saying: \"I can't do your homework for you.\"\nProfits at Morrisons have taken a beating amid intense competition from discount retailers such as Aldi and Lidl. Its share price too has tumbled 13% over the last year, leading to the supermarket's relegation from the Footsie on Friday (18 December).\nOn the back of the fall, Sir Ken, at an annual general meeting in June, showed his backing for Morrisons's new management and its turnaround plan. He said: \"It's a big job to restore the company's fortunes. Please be patient and allow the new management some breathing space.\"\nRapid growth\nMorrisons was started by Sir Ken's father as an egg-and-butter stall in Bradford. He, however, transformed it into the UK's fourth largest food retailer over 50 years.\nHe opened his first supermarket in 1961 in a converted cinema and floated Morrisons seven years hence after which there was no looking back as the company grew by leaps and bounds. The company witnessed an unbroken record of growing sales and profits until the botched acquisition of Safeway in 2004.\nIn 2011, Sir Ken was fined £210,000 for not disclosing the sale of more than £400m of Morrisons shares. This was considered a breach of stock market rules on \"disclosure and transparency\" by the regulator at the time — the Financial Services Authority — which said though Sir Ken did not financially benefit from the sale, his failure to inform Morrisons of the changes to his shareholding \"resulted in Wm Morrison not being in a position to update the market in accordance with the disclosure and transparency rules\".\nMore about UK Supermarkets\n",

  "articleText" : "Notes gain while shares drop most since 2012 on lower payouts\nBanks boost capital ratios as new rules increase bond risks\nShare on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp\nBarclays Plc Chief Executive Officer Jes Staley’s turnaround plan is reassuring debt investors even as shareholders run for the exit.\nThe bank’s riskiest bonds rose on Tuesday, and the cost of insuring its debt against default tumbled, after Staley announced steps to boost capital levels, including reducing a stake in an African unit and cutting dividends. The gains contrasted with a slump of as much as 11 percent in the London-based lender’s stock, the biggest decline in more than three years.\n“As bondholders, we don’t care so much about what shareholders care about,” said Francois Lavier, who oversees $3.4 billion of bank debt at Lazard Freres Gestion in Paris. “The question for us is: are we invested in a bank which is profitable and able to increase its level of capital?”\nBond investors are focusing on banks’ capital levels as new regulations increase the chances of them suffering losses if a lender runs into trouble. That heightened risk is denting demand for bank debt and forcing lenders such as Barclays and Deutsche Bank AG to shore up capital to maintain access to bond markets, even if it means disgruntled shareholders.\nCapital Ratio\nBarclays said cutting dividends and its sake in the Africa unit will help boost the common equity Tier 1 ratio by at least a percentage point. The measure was 11.4 percent at the end of 2015, up from 10.3 percent a year earlier. Banks can be prevented from making payments on additional Tier 1 notes, the riskiest debt securities, if capital ratios fall too low.\nBarclays’ 1.1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) of additional tier 1 bonds rose 2 cents on the euro to 86 cents, the highest since Feb. 23, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nThat’s still down from 101 cents at the start of the year, following a marketwide rout in banks’ contingent convertible notes caused by greater nervousness about the risks embedded in these types of bonds. Barclays and Deutsche Bank notes were among those that fell the most.\nBarclays cut its dividend to 3 pence per share for 2016 and 2017 from 6.5 pence last year. That helped push the stock to as low as 152.80 pence in London trading. The shares have dropped 21 percent this year.\n“There’s a divergence between the Barclays equity and debt stories,” said Paul Dilworth, an investment manager at Kames Capital Plc, an Edinburgh-based fixed-income firm that oversees about 55 billion pounds ($77 billion) including Barclays bonds. “They’re clearly now on two different trajectories.”\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

  "articleText" : "print\nLONDON (AP) — Anglo-Swedish drug firm AstraZeneca has acquired   U.S.-based biopharmaceutical company ZS Pharma in a deal worth   $2.7 billion.\nThe deal will give AstraZeneca access to ZS Pharma's treatment   for hyperkalemia, a condition of elevated potassium in the   bloodstream that is associated with chronic kidney disease and   chronic heart failure. The treatment, potassium-binding compound   ZS-9, is under regulatory review by the U.S. Food and Drug   Administration.\nThe deal values the San Mateo, California-based company at $90 a   share.\nZS Pharma's CEO Robert Alexander says the agreement will maximize the potential of ZS-9 and draw on AstraZeneca's expertise in   developing medicines for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.\nLike other big drugmakers, AstraZeneca is trying to build its   product portfolio to combat competition from generic drugmakers   as it loses exclusivity on top sellers.\nMore from Associated Press:\n",

  "articleText" : "Market Report: Sky rockets on buzz of Vivendi making a bid in European expansion\n \nThe sector was dealt another blow as Citi downgraded its stance on the entire metals and mining industry.\nThe investment bank said it was now neutral rather than bullish on the shares, saying “the self-help, cost-cutting and improving capital structure catalysts have played out and the sector is increasingly more vulnerable to lower commodity prices and macro conditions.”\nIt pointed to the strengthening US dollar, oversupply in bulk commodities and a slowing Chinese economy as red flags and cut its ratings on BHP Billiton, Glencore, Rio Tinto, Anglo American and Vedanta.\nBHP Billiton was among the top fallers on the Footsie, off 30.5p to 1433p and Anglo American dropped 14p to 1008p. On the mid-cap index Vedanta was down 6.5p at 509.75p.\nPearson was also in the red after Jefferies and Liberum gave downbeat views on its prospects.\nLiberum said LinkedIn’s recent purchase of online education site Lynda.com meant the Financial Times-owner now faces another major competitor in the education arena.\nJefferies cut its rating on Pearson to underperform from buy because of threats from the likes of iPad, iTunes U and Google Apps for Education.\n“With leading educators now publishing great content for nothing, our sense is that executing a ‘publisher’ model is getting tougher,” the broker said.\nPearson was down 36p at 1434.5p.\n",

  "articleText" : "View the article online at http://citywire.co.uk/money/article/a886580\nAdmiral and Schroders try to lift FTSE with profits surge\nBosses of car insurer Admiral and fund manager Schroders are sweeping out at a high point for their businesses but the FTSE 100 closed lower.\nMarkets\nFollow FundFanatic\nThe bosses of car insurer Admiral ( ADML ) and fund manager Schroders ( SDR ) are stepping down at a high point for their businesses, results today showed.\nAdmiral, whose chief executive and co-founder Henry Engelhardt (below) is leaving the company in May, was the biggest FTSE 100 riser, up  9% to 19.19p, after full-year profits smashed forecasts. The shares have gained 29% in the past 12 months.\nLast year the Cardiff-based firm saw pre-tax profits rise 6% to £377 million, ahead of analysts’ expectations of £350.4 million, helped by rising car insurance rates.\nIts combined operating ratio improved to 85.6% from 86.5%. Any reading below 100% shows an insurer is making an underwriting profit and is taking in more in premiums than it is paying out in claims.\nDividends also came in higher than expected with a special 29.8p per share dividend lifting the final payment to 63.4p and taking the total shareholders received for the year 16% higher to 114.4p.\nThere was a changing of the guard at Schroders too as the UK’s biggest stock market listed investment group said Michael Dobson, its long-serving chief executive, would be replaced by head of investment Peter Harrison on 4 April.\nDobson (pictured) is sticking around, however, moving sideways to be chairman, replacing Andrew Beeson, who is retiring.\nThe announcement came as Schroders’ full-year results impressed investors and sent its shares flying to £28.30 in early trading although they settled back and closed 20p (0.7%) higher at £27.38.\nProfits before tax and exceptional items last year advanced 7.9% to £609.7 million, higher than the £601.1 million consensus analyst forecast gathered by the company.\nNet inflows of new money into its funds and wealth management businesses hit £13 billion, beating analyst predictions of £12 billion.\nThe good news from the financial sector helped lift the FTSE 100 to trade nearly 12 points or 0.2% higher at 6,159 in the morning. This reversed in the afternoon and the index closed nearly 17 points or 0.3% down at 6,130.\nA cut by credit ratings agency Moody's in its outlook for the global pharmaceuticals industry knocked Shire ( SHP ) 3% lower at £37.55..\nInvestors are cautious ahead of this afternoon’s release of the first of two sets of US jobs data. Today’s ADP figures are a curtain raiser for the more significant non-farm payroll data tomorrow.\nInmarsat ( ISA ) fell 4.2% to 925p, after the satellite communications group posted a 3.6% rise in annual core profits but said trading conditions would continue to be difficult because of weak government spending.\nWhitbread ( WTB ) was the biggest FTSE 100 faller, dropping over 6% to £38 as a trading statement for the start of the year disappointed investors with like for sales growth of 2.2% at Premier Inn and 0.5% at Costa Coffee.\nSteve Clayton, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, the investment broker, said the company was a better proposition than the share price suggested. \n‘The stock has retreated by over 15% in the last year, and now trades on circa 15.4 times consensus earnings to January 2017, which is a little cheaper than its longer run average of 16 times. There are not that many stocks out there offering double-digit organic sales growth,’ he said.\nBHP Billiton ( BLT ) gained 2.7% (20p) to 799p on firmer metals prices and on news of a $5.1 billion settlement with the Brazilian government over the burst dam disaster in November involving mining company Samarco, which it jointly owns with Brazil’s Vale (VALE5.SA).\nIn the mid-cap FTSE 250 index Cobham ( COB ) tumbled nearly 8% (20p) to 239p after the defence contractor missed scaled-back expectations after a profits warning in November. Full-year earnings per share of 19.5p came in below the 20.1 to 21.7p range it had indicated.\nLonmin ( LMI ) was the fastest rising smaller company, racing 17% (18p) higher to 122p after the platinum miner announced the loss of 5,108 jobs in South Africa, less than expected, although unions said they were disappointed.\nIn Europe the FTSEurofirst 300 index dipped six points to 1,336.\nVolkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) shares firmed 0.4% to 116.2 euros  after the car maker issued its most detailed statement on the emissions cheating scandal that forced its chief executive to resign and wiped billions of euros off its market value.\nIt said Martin Winterkorn had been alerted to problems with US diesel emissions tests in 2014, a year before they became public. It has rejected accusations that it did not inform shareholders early enough but has set aside £4.9 billion in provisions for legal costs.\n",

  "articleText" : "Shell share price: Standard Life announce position against BG acquisition\nProposed terms are â€œvalue destructiveâ€� for shareholders, SL says\nby Veselin Valchev Monday, 11 Jan 2016, 12:53 GMT\nStandard Life, one of UKâ€™s leading investment funds and a top shareholder in both Royal Dutch Shell Plc (LON:RDSA) and BG Group, has become the first major shareholder to openly oppose the proposed Â£34 billion takeover of fellow energy giant BG Group.\nThe investment fund, which holds 0.4 percent of Shellâ€™s A shares and 1.7 percent of the B shares making it Shellâ€™s 11th top shareholder, said on Friday that the risk of further oil price declines and risks connected to BG's Brazilian assets, which are tied with embattled and indebted state-owned giant Petrobras, make the deal undesirable.\n\"We have concluded that the proposed terms of the acquisition of BG are value destructive for Shell shareholders,\" said David Cumming, head of equities at Standard Life Investments. â€œThis view is based on the downside risks to Shellâ€™s oil price assumptions plus the tax and operational risks surrounding BGâ€™s Brazilian asset base. Consequently we shall vote against the deal.â€�\nStandard Life, which is also BG Groupâ€™s 16th largest shareholder with a 1.3 percent stake, has held meetings with Shell executives in a bid to convince management to renegotiate the terms.\nShell did not comment on Standard Lifeâ€™s statement, but a spokesman said on Friday, following a call for the dealâ€™s endorsement by an influential adviser, that the company believes it has â€œthe broad base of shareholder support we need for the deal to completeâ€�.\nâ€œCompelling strategic rationaleâ€�\nInstitutional Shareholder Services (ISS), a key shareholder advisory firm, said in a report released on Friday that the recent slump in oil prices does not take away from the â€œstrategic opportunity of a transaction whose benefits will be realized over decadesâ€�.\n\"There is credible evidence... that the price Shell is paying is reasonable even considering the decline in oil prices and oil stocks since the deal was announced,â€� ISS said in a report released today. \"Given the compelling strategic rationale, and the significant positive economics to be realized within a relatively short time frame, support for the transaction is warranted.\"\nFellow proxy adviser Glass Lewis, which advises 12 of Shell's top 50 shareholders, also advised investors to back the merger late on Friday, saying the deal \"could lead to significantly improved financial results and the creation of substantial shareholder value\".\nShell and BGâ€™s shareholders are set to vote on the merger on January 27 and 28, respectively, with Shell required to secure backing from 50 percent of its shareholders, while BG must win approval from 75 percent of its investors. The merger is likely to become effective February 15, Shell has said.\nShellâ€™s share price closed the first week of 2016 with a 10 percent loss, which compares with a 10 percent drop in oil prices and a five-percent fall for the FTSE 100. Shell closed 2015 some 30 percent in the red.\n",

  "articleText" : "Household International investors reach accord after 14 years\nHSBC bought Household International for $15.5 billion in 2003\nShare on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp\nHSBC Holdings Plc agreed to pay $1.58 billion to settle a 14-year-old shareholder lawsuit over allegations that executives of a U.S. subprime-lending business acquired by the bank misled investors.\nThe HSBC Finance unit will record a $585 million pretax charge in the second quarter to resolve the litigation, which the parent company inherited through its 2003 acquisition of Household International, the bank said Thursday in a statement. The settlement is subject to court approval.\n“This settlement is too small to have any influence over dividend decisions,” Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc. analysts Mark Phin and Richard Smith wrote in a note to investors. “We had nothing explicit in our estimates for this case, but have $2 billion for litigation until 2017 and remain broadly comfortable with that.”\nHSBC has been reducing staff and cutting costs as revenue growth slows in its key markets across Asia and the U.K. The lender has also been striving to bring misconduct costs and litigation charges to an end, boosting its compliance workforce to about 9,000 staff from 1,500 in 2010. The pace of hiring accelerated after U.S. authorities fined the bank $1.9 billion in 2012 and charged it with violating sanctions laws and allowing Mexican drug traffickers to launder hundreds of millions of dollars.\nThe pretax charge represents about 9 percent of the $6.57 billion in pretax profit the KBW analysts had estimated for the second quarter before the announcement.\nInvestors Sue\nInvestors of Household International sued in 2002, alleging the company and three executives made misleading comments about mortgage-lending practices.\nA federal jury in Chicago in 2009 ruled that executives at Household, which was acquired by London-based HSBC in March 2003 for $15.5 billion, made recklessly misleading comments. In October 2013, a judge entered a $2.46 billion judgment against HSBC on some claims.\nHSBC won a new trial in the case in May 2015 after an appeals court said the investors hadn’t shown that a drop in the company’s share price wasn’t the result of other factors. That trial had been scheduled to begin last week.\nThe acquisition of Prospect Heights, Illinois-based Household International contributed to record bad debts at HSBC’s North American division before it decided to halt subprime lending from the unit in March 2009.\nThe case is Jaffe Pension Plan v. Household International Inc., 02-cv-05893, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois (Chicago).\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal. LEARN MORE\n",

The company has issued four profit warnings in just over a year.\nThe UK's blue-chip FTSE 100 index was up 0.7 percent at 6,058.65 points by 1024 GMT, outperforming the broader European market.\nAfter the European market close, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise U.S. interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.\n\"The overriding expectation is for a 25 basis point hike (which is more or less priced in already) while the real market-moving aspect will undoubtedly be the Fed's language for its indications as to the future pace of tightening,\" analysts Mike van Dulken and Augustin Eden at Accendo Markets wrote in a note.\nThe prospect of a small hike that could bring some stability to markets helped support commodity-related stocks, with shares in BP up 1.7 percent and Royal Dutch Shell  advancing 1.3 percent. Miners BHP Billiton, Antofagasta  and Glencore were up between 0.6 percent and 2.7 percent.\nBritish supermarkets found themselves at the bottom of the index following a rally on the back of industry data in the previous session.\n\"This is a critical time for the retailers ... are they going to get the footfall, how much are the discounters going to bend their sales?\" said Danny Cox, chartered financial planner at Hargreaves Lansdown.\nGrocer Tesco was down 1.6 percent, followed by Marks & Spencer, Sainsbury and Morrison , which were all down between 0.3 percent to 1 percent.

  "articleText" : "Dermatology business to be hurt by Philidor shutdown\nShares slide in early trading after two days of gains\nShare on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp\nStriking a more reflective tone and pledging to listen to critics, Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mike Pearson sought to regain confidence from investors in remarks that painted a fuller picture of the drugmaker’s financial exposure to a controversial pharmacy partner.\nThe shares slumped, suggesting he still has work to do. The stock slid 7.2 percent to $79.25 at 11:13 a.m. in New York, after closing up the two days prior.\nIn his first public comments since Valeant said it would cut ties with Philidor Rx Services, Pearson warned that the impact of the decision would meaningfully affect the dermatology business, which makes up almost a fifth of total revenue. On an almost 90-minute conference call Tuesday, he said the company was working to forge better relationships with insurers and to create a new program to ensure patients could get and afford the company’s products.\n“The past few weeks have been a painful learning experience for me personally, and I know it has been painful for many of you as well,” Pearson said.\nConcerns about Philidor and other business practices by Valeant, such as how it prices its drugs, have turned the drugmaker from one of the market’s top-performing stocks into one of its worst. From the start of 2010, Valeant shares rose more than 18-fold to peak in August. Since that peak, they have lost 67 percent of their value, as of Monday’s close.\n“One of the consequences of such rapid growth is that you don’t always take the time to listen to what the broader world outside your company is saying,” Pearson said. “This has been a mistake on our part as a company and on my part as its leader. We’re going to fix that.”\nPearson made some headway, said Shibani Malhotra, an analyst with Nomura Securities. “We thought they did a very good job explaining, and in the past they’ve had very scripted responses,” she said in an interview. “We’ve spoken to the management and we’ve given them advice that they should just answer the questions really honestly and openly, and I think they did that.” Malhotra has a buy rating on the stock.\nPearson’s message was more conciliatory than his comments during an Oct. 26 call, when the CEO denied allegations that the company was inflating sales figures through its relationship with Philidor. On that earlier call, while he acknowledged being slow to answer investors’ questions, he also lashed out at stock commentary site Citron Research, which he accused of the equivalent of yelling “Fire!” in a crowded theater.\nTaking Questions\nBy contrast, Tuesday’s call featured no slide-deck presentation, and Pearson devoted the majority of the time to fielding analysts’ questions.\nPearson said he couldn’t comment on a board investigation into the relationship with Philidor, though he said the pharmacy’s executives have assured him they did nothing wrong. Former Philidor employees have alleged that the pharmacy altered some doctors’ orders to specify that they wanted brand-name drugs instead of generics, a way to get larger reimbursements for Valeant from health insurers. Philidor said that it only filled prescriptions with medications that doctors and patients requested. Weeks before Valeant said it would cut ties with Philidor, the drugmaker\nwas planning to expand the relationship, Bloomberg has reported.\n“Other allegations were made, in terms of the practices of Philidor,” Pearson said Tuesday. “Management felt that given those allegations, given what was happening to our share price, that the best course of action was to cut ties with Philidor.”\nWinding Down\nPhilidor has stopped adjudicating insurance claims and will wind down operations by Jan. 30, and Valeant will develop a new program to help patients get its drugs by that time, Pearson said Tuesday. In the meantime, some prescriptions are being filled for free, and the company is discounting some treatments more deeply so physicians will keep prescribing them, he said. That will contribute to lower revenue from dermatology products in the fourth quarter, he said.\n“Our strategy is actually to keep the volume, even if we have much lower prices in the short-term,” Pearson said. “What we want to do is make sure doctors continue to not change their behavior.”\nDermatological sales were $465.5 million in the U.S. last quarter, out of total revenue of $2.79 billion. Philidor represented about $190 million in third-quarter sales, almost all of which were for dermatological products, Pearson said.\nAckman’s Defense\nBill Ackman, the billionaire hedge fund manager who runs Pershing Square Capital Management LP, is Valeant’s third-biggest holder and has been one of the drugmaker’s biggest defenders. On a conference call with investors Monday, Ackman called the company “largely a victim of fear and panic.”\n“I think that key shareholders probably support them still,” Malhotra said. “If this goes on for another six months, then that’s a question we’d ask again.”\nValeant\nsaid on Oct. 19 that it might sell its neurology drugs unit, would invest more in research and development, and was less likely to buy companies and then raise the prices of drugs acquired in the deal. Pearson said on Oct. 26 the Philidor issue had put the possible sale of the neurology unit “\non the back burner .”\nValeant has said it will host an investor day and update financial forecasts before the end of the year. The company will spend “the lion’s share” of its incoming cash on debt repayment next year, Pearson said Tuesday, and share buybacks are off the table in the short-term.\n“The company is going to survive. The cash flows are strong and our momentum is good,” he said. “We are going to get through these issues.”\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal. LEARN MORE\n",

The transaction fulfils our strategy to focus on growing a portfolio of high-quality retail destinations in prime locations, which stand to benefit from high footfall, attractive catchments and positive consumer trends. In partnership with Allianz, I believe we are well positioned to maximise the future potential of these properties and deliver consistent returns for our shareholders.”\nReal estate portfolio (“Collateral Assets”)\nThe loan portfolio is secured by best-in-class retail assets:\nDundrum Town Centre (“Dundrum”)\nOpened in 2005, Dundrum is Ireland’s premier retail and leisure destination. The centre extends to approximately 1.5 million sq ft (140,000 sq m) and is anchored by four department and flagship stores (House of Fraser, M&S, Harvey Nichols and Penneys) alongside a Tesco superstore, 120 retail shops, 38 restaurants, 12 screen VIP cinema and 3,400 space customer car park.\nDundrum is located 5km south of Dublin City Centre, and is well connected through excellent public transport access serviced by the light rail Luas service and is adjacent to exit 13 of the M50 Motorway.\nThe centre benefits from one of the most affluent and densely populated catchment areas in Ireland, with 71% of the primary catchment being categorised as ABC1.\nDundrum has won over 30 industry awards and is Ireland’s only super prime regional shopping centre. The centre has created a retail and leisure leasing proposition unique in Ireland, accommodating more than thirty ‘first to Ireland’ international tenants, including House of Fraser, Harvey Nichols, Hollister, Aldo, Starbucks, Jamie’s Italian, H&M, Hugo Boss and Bershka. The large modern units have attracted international retailers and 63% of the centre’s income comes from international brands.\nContracted rent of €60 million (£44 million) offers significant growth potential with rents in Dundrum c.70% of equivalent retail units on Grafton Street in Dublin City Centre, offering reversion potential of c.15%. Many of the brands trade in the top quartile of their store portfolios and there is identified demand from existing retailers for expansion as well as new brands looking to use Dundrum as a platform to enter Ireland.\nThe centre is currently at 98% occupancy and the weighted average unexpired lease term (“WAULT”) is 15 years. 90% of the leases are subject to upward-only rent reviews.\nThe centre sees annual footfall of 18 million and is combined with a high average dwell time of around two hours. Current annual sales for Dundrum Town Centre are estimated at around €500 million (£370 million).\nDundrum Village (“Dundrum Phase 2”)\nDundrum Phase 2 is a 6-acre site located directly adjacent to Dundrum Town Centre. The site provides the opportunity to expand the successful Dundrum retail and leisure offering or to develop with a complementary mixed-use offering.\nSituated next to the Luas station with direct links to Dublin Centre, and near to Dublin’s exclusive residential areas of Ballsbridge and Donnybrook, the site offers a desirable location for future development.\nThe site benefits from being categorised as a Major Town Centre and has previously been granted planning permission for a 1.15 million sq ft (110,000 sq m) development of retail, dining and leisure facilities although this permission would need to be renewed.\nThe site currently houses retail properties let on short term leases to facilitate development. The site generates gross annual rents of €1.3 million (£1.0 million).\nThe Pavilions, Swords\nThe Pavilions is the prime retail centre serving Dublin’s northern suburbs, situated directly adjacent to the M1 motorway. Completed in 1999, the centre was subsequently extended in 2006 to provide approximately 490,000 sq ft (46,000 sq m) of retail and leisure space. The centre is anchored by Dunnes Stores, Ireland’s largest retailer, SuperValu, Ireland’s largest grocery chain, and Penneys (not included in Collateral Assets), alongside 70 retail shops and restaurants, an 11-screen cinema and 2,000 space car park. The asset is owned in co-ownership with IPUT (25%) and Irish Life (25%).\nThe Pavilions offers an attractive retail and leisure mix with a combination of international brands such as Zara, H&M, River Island, Tommy Hilfiger and Next. The cinema is let to Movies @ Swords cinema, which is ranked within the top five in the country. A number of recent lettings to major international retailers have been achieved.\nThe Pavilions has an annual footfall of 12 million and is located in the most affluent catchment of North Dublin, with 62% of the primary catchment categorised as ABC1.\nThe centre has high occupancy of 99% and contracted rent at The Pavilions is €15 million (£11 million) (100% of centre) with WAULT to expiry of 11 years.\nAdjacent to the existing centre is a 16-acre development site. This is not within the co-ownership with IPUT and Irish Life. Outline planning permission has been granted for a 1.2 mil sq ft retail-led mixed use development (including 0.7 mil sq ft of retail space).\nThe Ilac Centre, Dublin\nThe Ilac Centre offers one of the largest City Centre malls within Dublin’s primary shopping area. It sits at the heart of Dublin’s retail core, bounded by Henry Street to the south, Moore Street to the east and Parnell Street to the north. Henry Street is the busiest shopping street in Ireland, with footfall of 30 million per annum. The street has a significant retail offer with Arnotts department store, M&S, Debenhams, Dunnes, Penneys and The Jervis Centre. The asset is owned jointly with Irish Life (50%).\nIlac is configured over a single level, comprising four malls surrounding a central square with approximately 160,000 sq ft (15,000 sq m) of retail accommodation. It includes 85 retail and catering units with a value-led retail proposition. TK Maxx, Boots, Argos, H&M and River Island are key tenants.\nThe centre underwent a €60 million refurbishment in 2008 which improved design, external frontages, lighting and the internal environment.\nThe centre’s north-central location is easily accessible by public transport which is provided by many city centre bus routes. The centre also benefits from light rail connections to the Luas service. Footfall is supported by the connection to the largest car park in the north of the city centre with over 1,000 spaces. This is owned and operated by Dublin City Council. As a result of its connections, the centre sees footfall of 18 million per year.\nContracted rent from The Ilac Centre is €10 million (£7 million) (100%) with 99% occupancy and WAULT to expiry of 10 years.\nDublin Central Development site\nThe Dublin Central Development site located adjacent to The Ilac shopping centre is a 5.3-acre area in the heart of central Dublin. With a combination of impressive scale and irreplaceable location, the site is one of the best-positioned urban retail development sites in Europe.\nAssembled over the course of a decade, the site comprises multiple buildings along Henry Street, O’Connell Street and Parnell Street. With its strategic location and mix of current tenants, the site offers the flexibility to pursue numerous development scenarios and deliver a modern landmark of international importance that is sympathetic to the neighbourhood’s history.\nThe buildings on the site have a combined area of 1.4 million sq ft with a mix of retail, office, restaurants and residential. They are currently predominantly let to local operators on short-term leases and the site generates gross rents of €2.4 million (£2.0 million).\nTransaction structure and funding\nThe loan acquisition is being made through a 50:50 joint venture between Hammerson and Allianz. The purchase price paid by the JV for the loans secured against the Collateral Assets is €1.85 billion (£1.37 billion). The face value of the loans is €2.57 billion (£1.90 billion).\nUnder the long term joint venture structure, Hammerson would own 50% of Dundrum Town Centre and Dundrum Phase 2 alongside Allianz, and act as asset and development manager. Hammerson would own 100% of the remainder of the Collateral Assets (being the Dublin Central Development site, The Ilac Centre (50%), The Pavilions (50%)). Following the final allocation of properties, Hammerson’s total share of the consideration would be €1.23 billion (£0.91 billion).\nA sum equivalent to 10% of the purchase price will be paid by the JV this week. The residual payment to NAMA for the loans is to be made upon closing, expected to occur before 30 October 2015.\nHammerson will fund its €1.23 billion (£0.91 billion) share of the transaction from existing financial resources and a new €1.0 billion revolving credit facility with a maturity of March 2017. Management is committed to maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating and believes that the acquisition also enhances the quality, diversity and income security of our portfolio. The new credit facility will be refinanced from a combination of an acceleration of the current disposal programme and future capital markets issuance. During the course of 2015, Hammerson has announced disposals of £155 million, recycling capital into those assets which are best positioned to deliver value creation for shareholders. We are currently marketing a further £200m of assets for sale. We also intend to execute previously identified disposal opportunities by the end of 2016 which could total up to a further £300 million. The management team remains committed to a long-term strategy of prudent leverage in line with its policies of less than 40% LTV and 10x net debt to EBITDA ratio.\nManagement and strategy for period of loan ownership\nA new specialist Irish team has been established within Hammerson focused on the management of the loan portfolio and future operational initiatives.\nHammerson is committed to ensuring the most appropriate outcome for all parties, including NAMA’s commitments to stability in the property markets, fair and transparent discussions with the borrowers, ensuring the assets meet their future potential for the communities they serve and delivering shareholder returns.\nThe secured loans that Hammerson and Allianz have acquired have expired and repayment on demand can be requested. The borrowers are not expected to be in a position to repay the loan amounts due. It is the primary goal of the joint venture to acquire ownership of the Collateral Assets by way of a consensual agreement with the borrowers.\nThe joint venture anticipates owning the properties by the summer of 2016.\nFinancial effects\nTotal contracted rent on the underlying properties of the portfolio is €88 million (£65 million) reflecting an initial yield of 4.0% and a reversionary yield of 4.6% (excluding development properties).\nSince the loans have expired, default interest is applicable which has the effect of sweeping all rent payable from the Collateral Assets on which the loans are secured. The total interest receivable on the loans currently is approximately €65 million (£48 million), equating to a cash yield of 3.5%.\nThe portfolio provides a projected 5 year IRR of 7-8%, exceeding Hammerson’s weighted average cost of capital. These returns are supported by positive rental reversion at Dundrum. Opportunities to pursue development schemes at Dundrum Phase 2, Dublin Central and The Pavilions provide material value upside potential.\nThe transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to EPS and with medium term accretion to EPRA NAVPS.\nProforma for the acquisition of the loan portfolio, LTV will be 40% and gearing will be 59%, with liquidity of over £350 million. We anticipate following planned disposals of £500 million in total that LTV will be mid-30%.\nAdvisers\nOn this transaction, Hammerson were advised by Lazard, Herbert Smith Freehills, William Fry, KPMG and CBRE.\nInvestor conference call\nA conference call for analysts and investors will be held today at 08:30 BST and a presentation to accompany this call is available on Hammerson’s website at www.hammerson.com\nParticipants, Local – London, United Kingdom: +44(0)20 3364 5729\nParticipants, Local – New York, United States of America: +1646 254 3371\nParticipants, Local – Paris, France: +33(0)1 76 77 22 42\nParticipants, Local – Amsterdam, Netherlands: +31(0)20 721 9157\nConfirmation Code: 5748991\nThe webcast link is  http://edge.media-server.com/m/p/eyowkguy\nFor further information\n",

Many analysts say that decline had prompted AB InBev to finally launch a takeover offer that had been speculated about for years.\nOn a reported basis, including the currency impact, revenue fell 12 percent to $10.0 billion and earnings before interest, tax and amortisation (EBITA) fell 11 percent to $2.9 billion in the six months to Sept. 30.\nSABMiller said growth would continue to be driven by developing markets and its focus on more premium drinks, though foreign exchange and higher raw material costs would still weigh on results.\nIt said it planned to deliver more than $430 million in annual savings by the end of its fiscal year, on 31 March 2016. That is ahead of its original target, for savings of $500 million by 2018.\n\"The SABMiller board does believe that our strategy would have delivered further value to our shareholders over the long term. However, AB InBev's offer secures that value today, which is why the board unanimously recommended it,\" SABMiller Chief Executive Alan Clark said on a conference call.\nThe takeover of the company, one of the largest in corporate history, is not expected to close until the second half of 2016, due to various antitrust approvals needed.\nIn the meantime, SABMiller said it was committed to keeping employees motivated, despite what Clark described as a general tone of uncertainty among staff around future job security.\nHe said the combination of its African soft drink bottling assets with those of Coca-Cola, a deal announced nearly a year ago, was on track to complete in coming months. He declined to say what would happen to the business after the takeover by AB InBev, which serves as a bottler for PepsiCo.\nHe also told reporters it was too early to talk about SABMiller's stakes in France's Castel Group and Turkey's Anadolu Efes or his own career intentions following the takeover.

  "articleText" : "Business News | Sun Apr 19, 2015 | 3:30pm BST\nInsight - Britain's bank tax jump threatens to push HSBC, StanChart to new home\nAn HSBC sign is seen outside a bank branch near the Shard in London February 9, 2015. REUTERS/Suzanne Plunkett\nBy Steve Slater and Sinead Cruise | LONDON\nLONDON HSBC and Standard Chartered are looking at the viability of quitting London for a new home in Asia because a big jump in a tax on UK banks makes staying in Britain increasingly painful.\nSeveral investors told Reuters they want the two banks to do a thorough analysis on whether it makes sense to move after Britain raised the bank tax by a third last month.\nSome are expected to quiz bosses on it at shareholder meetings, including at an investor gathering in Hong Kong on Monday.\n\"There is a very clear risk that HSBC and StanChart reach a pain threshold where they think it is no longer worth staying in the UK,\" said Richard Buxton, head of equities at Old Mutual Global Investors, which owns HSBC shares and who said the bank was reflecting on a move.\nThe tax has increased eight times since being introduced in 2010 to ensure banks make a \"fair contribution\" after the financial crisis. The latest rise was seen as a popular move ahead of Britain's May 7 election.\nAberdeen Asset Management, the second biggest shareholder in Standard Chartered, with an aggregate 9.4 percent stake, said the bank should consider the option.\nSenior management are already assessing the situation, people familiar with the matter said. Four years ago, HSBC said it would review its domicile in 2015, although the bank declined to comment if or when any review might occur.\n\"It's a live conversation internally because it's an issue being raised by investors and sell-side analysts,\" said a person close to one of the banks, who asked not to be named as the discussions are private.\nThe banks, who make most of their profits in Asia, face a combined $2 billion (£1.3 billion) bill this year under the annual UK bank tax, up from $1.5 billion last year and almost double what they paid in 2013.\nThe Labour Party plans to increase it by 800 million pounds to 4.5 billion pounds a year for the banking industry as a whole, if it wins power, to pay for childcare for three and four year olds. Labour is neck and neck with Prime Minister David Cameron's Conservatives in polls.\nAnother hefty rise could be the final catalyst and force banks to move, Bernstein analyst Chirantan Barua said.\nHSBC, which has described the levy as a tax on staying in London, faces a bill of $1.5 billion this year, about 7 percent of expected profits. Standard Chartered is set to pay $500 million, or about 9 percent of earnings.\n\"TOO MANY MOVING PARTS\"\nHSBC says it has two \"home\" markets, Britain and Hong Kong. It moved from Hong Kong to London in 1993 when it bought Midland Bank and its most likely move would be back to its former home, one of the few places that could handle its $2.6 trillion balance sheet.\nThe bank began life in Hong Kong 150 years ago, with roots as a financier of trade between Europe and Asia. It issues most of the territory's bank notes and has made $24 billion in profits there over the last three years, compared to a $4 billion loss in Britain over the same period.\nLondon has been home to Standard Chartered since it was formed in 1969 and its most likely new home would be Singapore, from where most of its businesses are already run.\nAnalysts said the cost of moving could be between $1.5 billion and $2.5 billion per bank.\nHSBC told MPs in February, before the levy increase, the best location was still Britain. It had postponed a review in 2011 because Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver said there were too many moving parts to make a rational decision.\nIndustry sources said that could still be the case for both banks. They are trying to improve profitability, cut costs, sell businesses, deal with old misconduct issues and simplify. Standard Chartered also gets a new CEO next month, Bill Winters, who may want to raise capital.\n\"On a 10 or 15 year view, I'd be surprised if both of them are still here. But I don't think it's an issue for the short-term, they have bigger priorities,\" John-Paul Crutchley, UBS banking analyst, said.\nYet it could be worth it. JPMorgan analyst Raul Sinha estimated the higher UK bank levy will cut Standard Chartered's earnings by 13 percent in 2017, while a move away from Britain could lift its return on tangible equity, a key profitability measure, by 1.6 percentage points to 12.7 percent.\nBritain is also forcing banks to separate domestic retail operations by 2019, so if HSBC is serious about moving, it could spin off its UK business at the same time, analysts said.\nBut the complexity of all the issues in the mix make a decision difficult. These include Europe's pay rules for staff, the risk of losing staff, how capital and leverage rules in places like Singapore compare, access to capital, political stability, credit ratings and the risk of regulatory change in any new jurisdiction.\nBritain's strongest card is London itself, which has always ranked alongside New York as the most attractive global financial hub, in the Z/Yen Global Financial Centres index.\nBanks, accused of sabre-rattling with threats to quit before, are also wary of stepping into a political minefield.\n\"StanChart and HSBC might well be firing warning shots on their possible relocation to ... tell politicians they won’t be bullied,\" said Paul Mumford, senior investment manager at Cavendish Asset Management, which owns stock in both banks.\n\"But I think unless these firms start feeling that some politicians are in tune with what they offer the UK, then we might see genuine action ... the threat is there,\" he said.\n(Editing by Jane Merriman)\n",

REUTERS/Thomas Peter\nBy Philip Blenkinsop and Foo Yun Chee | BRUSSELS\nBRUSSELS EU antitrust regulators have dropped Shell, BP, and Statoil from an investigation into suspected rigging of ethanol benchmarks, focusing instead on three producers of the biofuel.\nThe European Commission said on Monday it had opened a formal antitrust investigation into the actions of Spanish company Abengoa SA, Belgium's Alcogroup SA and Lantmännen ek för of Sweden.\nIn April, EU antitrust regulators raided several bioenthanol companies and at the same time stepped up a two-year investigation into biofuel price benchmarks. In 2013, it searched the offices of BP, Shell and Statoil too.\nBP, Shell, Statoil and price reporting agency Platts have been told they are not part of the investigation opened on Monday, two sources familiar with the matter said.\n\"The Commission's investigation focuses on behaviors in price benchmarks for the ethanol sector,\" the EU competition authority said in response to an email asking if crude oil and refined products were still being assessed.\n\"The Commission is currently not investigating further behaviors in price benchmarks for the crude oil sector.\"\nBP was not immediately available for comment, Shell declined to comment, and a spokeswoman for Norwegian state producer Statoil said there were no formal charges or accusations against the company.\nThe Commission said it was concerned that Abengoa, Alcogroup  and Lantmännen ek för may have colluded to manipulate ethanol benchmarks published by Platts.\nIt said this could include agreeing to submit or support bids to hike the benchmark and so drive up ethanol prices, leading to less use of biofuels as an alternative to fossil fuels, with negative consequences for consumers and the environment.\nPlatts said it had not been charged with any wrongdoing and was not an addressee of the European Commission's statement of objections in relation to the bioethanol pricing investigation.\nAlcogroup said: \"Alcodis and Alcogroup operate their activities in accordance with European law and therefore fully cooperate with the European Commission whilst ensuring their fundamental rights to be respected.\"\nLantmännen said it \"cooperates fully with the authority\". Abengoa was not immediately available for comment.\nIn a separate case, the Commission is also investigating several bioethanol producers on suspicion of taking part in a cartel following searches of offices. The sources said the oil majors are not involved in this case either.\nEthanol is made from biomass such as wheat, maize or sugar beet that is mainly added to gasoline and used as a biofuel for certain motor vehicles.\n(Reporting by Philip Blenkinsop; Addtional reporting by Dmitry Zhdannikov in London and Gwladys Fouche in Oslo; Editing by Susan Thomas)\nNext In Commodities\nIran optimistic on OPEC deal after meeting Algerian minister\nDUBAI Iran is optimistic OPEC can reach a deal on limiting oil supplies and plans to announce its own decision about any output curbs at the group's meeting next week, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on the ministry's official website SHANA.\nSaudi wants OPEC to solve own problems before meeting non-OPEC\nDUBAI/LONDON Top OPEC oil exporter Saudi Arabia has told the producer group it will not attend talks on Monday with non-OPEC producers to discuss limiting supply, OPEC sources said, as it wants to focus on having consensus within the organization first.\nShell CEO expects no valuation hit from climate accord\nAMSTERDAM Royal Dutch Shell expects to pump out all the fossil fuel reserves listed on its balance sheet, its chief executive said, dismissing concerns that production limits in the wake of the Paris climate accord could hit the energy giant's valuation.\nMORE FROM REUTERS\nFrom Around the Web Promoted by Taboola\nTrending Stories\n",

REUTERS/Phil Noble\nBy Ben Hirschler | LONDON\nLONDON AstraZeneca said on Monday it was in talks that might lead to the acquisition of privately held biotech firm Acerta Pharma, a potential $5 billion-plus deal designed to build up its cancer drug portfolio.\n\"AstraZeneca confirms that it is exploring potential strategic options with Acerta Pharma BV. There can be no certainty that any transaction will ultimately be entered into, or as to the terms of any transaction,\" it said in a brief statement.\nCredit Suisse analysts said acalabrutinib's considerable potential could also encourage other potential buyers. \"If Acerta is open to a transaction, we would expect significant interest from multiple other bidders,\" they said in a note.\nThe Wall Street Journal had reported on Friday that the British drugmaker was looking to buy Acerta for more than $5 billion to gain access to its experimental blood cancer drug acalabrutinib.\nAcalabrutinib works in a similar way to Imbruvica, which was developed by Pharmacyclics but is now controlled by AbbVie after the U.S. drugmaker bought Pharmacyclics for $21 billion earlier this year. Johnson & Johnson jointly markets Imbruvica.\nBoth drugs are so-called Burton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors that target an array of blood cancers and have the potential to become multibillion-dollar-a-year sellers, according to industry analysts. They may also help in autoimmune diseases like lupus.\nGiven pharmaceutical companies' current heated interest in oncology, Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said it was not surprising that Acerta, based in California and the Netherlands, was an acquisition candidate.\nPIPELINE BOOST\nAcerta does not yet have a partner to help develop its leading drug, although it has agreed to test acalabrutinib in combination with Merck's Keytruda.\nAcerta is running a wide range of cancer clinical trials, including two final-stage Phase III studies. Last week it reported positive results in leukemia.\nThe decision to chase after Acerta reflects a determination by AstraZeneca Chief Executive Pascal Soriot to use deals to boost his company's pipeline as sales of older blockbusters, including cholesterol fighter Crestor, lose patent protection.\nLast month he agreed to buy ZS Pharma, a specialist in treating high potassium levels, for $2.7 billion.\nThe biggest hopes are pinned on oncology, however, where AstraZeneca already has a goal of bringing six new cancer treatments to market by 2020.\nIts new lung cancer pill Tagrisso, which it believes could sell $3 billion a year, was approved last month and the company also recently launched Lynparza for ovarian cancer.\nBuying Acerta would take AstraZeneca into the less familiar territory of blood cancers and some analysts said the move suggested a bigger commitment to this area of oncology than initially expected.\nEarlier this year AstraZeneca signed a deal to co-develop another cancer drug, durvalumab, in blood cancers with Celgene because it said at the time it had limited experience in the field.\n(Editing by Mark Potter and Keith Weir)\nNext In Deals\n",

REUTERS/Phil Noble\nBy Toni Clarke | WASHINGTON\nWASHINGTON AstraZeneca Plc's diabetes drug Onglyza and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co.'s rival product Nesina should carry information about the risk of heart failure, an advisory committee to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Tuesday.\nHeart failure is a condition in which the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. It can be caused by coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, diabetes or obesity, according to the Mayo Clinic.\nThe panel reviewed safety data on AstraZeneca's Onglyza and Takeda's Nesina. The drugs belong to a class known as DPP-4 inhibitors which also includes Merck & Co.'s Januvia. Januvia data from a trial known as TECOS will be presented at a scientific meeting in June.\nThe studies were requested by the FDA as part of a broader investigation into the safety of diabetes drugs. In December 2008, the agency issued guidance requiring companies to conduct studies to show the drugs did not increase cardiovascular risk.\nThe panel found that neither Onglyza nor Nesina increased the risk of cardiovascular death, stroke or heart attack. But data showed a statistically significant increase in the risk of heart failure with Onglyza and an increased risk with Nesina that did not reach statistical significance.\nSome panelists said that even though the heart failure risk seen with Nesina was modest, they suspect the risk will turn out to be a DPP-4 class effect and therefore worth including.\nThe panel did not recommend any restrictions on prescribing the drugs. AstraZeneca's U.S. shares rose 3.2 percent. Takeda's shares closed down 0.67 percent before the vote was announced. Merck's shares rose 1.8 percent.\n\"Given the absence of a serious safety issue for either Onglyza or Takeda's Nesina suggests that, barring an overtly negative signal in TECOS, growth of the DPP-4 class is likely to continue without a meaningful change in current prescribing trends,\" Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said in a research note.\nA preliminary FDA review of Onglyza published on Friday found an increase in the rate of death from all causes. Panel members said they were moderately concerned about the signal but said their concern was muted by the fact that the causes of death were varied and lacked any common theme.\nOnglyza, known also as saxagliptin, was approved in 2009. Nesina, or alogliptin, was approved in 2013. The FDA is not obliged to follow the advice of its advisory panels but typically does so.\n(Reporting by Toni Clarke; Editing by Will Dunham and Andrew Hay)\nNext In Health News\n",

But which offers the best investment opportunity?\nEarnings\nA glance at the two banks'  income statements reveals that in recent years, Lloyds has had more earnings momentum than rival Barclays. Lloyds has generated earnings growth of 29% over the last three financial years, reporting adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 6.6p, 8.1p and 8.5p for FY2013-2015. Barclays has seen more modest growth of 9% in this time, reporting earnings of 15.3p, 17.3p and 16.6p.\nCity analysts forecast consecutive earnings declines for Lloyds, with FY2016-2017 earnings of 7.2p (-18%) and 6.6p (-9%) estimated. By contrast, earnings at Barclays are predicted to fall and then rise, with 11.4p (-46%) and 18.7p (+39%) forecast. \nIs there a definitive winner here? It's a tough call. With Lloyds generating 100% of its income in the UK compared to 48% for Barclays, much is likely to depend on how Brexit affects the UK economy and the implications this has for the financial sector. \nDividends\nHowever, when it comes to dividends, it's easier to pick a winner. There's no doubt Barclays trumped Lloyds in recent years in terms of dividend consistency, paying out 6.5p per share each year for FY2013-2015, compared to Lloyds' 0.00p, 0.75p and 2.75p in this time.\nHowever looking forward it's a different story as Barclays announced earlier this year that it would be cutting its dividend for FY2016. Barclays is now forecast to pay just 3p this year and next year, which on the current share price, equates to a yield of just 1.4%.\nBut Lloyds is forecast to pay 3.16p this year and 3.7p next year, yields of 5.4% and 6.3% respectively, and the bank has reiterated its commitment to a progressive and sustainable ordinary dividend. Lloyds clearly has the momentum here, and while the bank's future dividend payouts are certainly not guaranteed, I believe that Lloyds has the brighter dividend prospects in the near term. \nPrice\nLloyds' shares fell heavily after the Brexit result and are down 19% year-to-date. With analysts forecasting EPS of 7.2p for FY2016,  the bank trades on a forward looking P/E multiple of 8.2.\nBarclays shares are down just 4% for the year now and at the current share price of 210p, the bank trades on a forward looking P/E ratio of 18.4. On this metric, Lloyds appears to be the cheaper stock.\nWhich stock would I buy?\nOne thing that appeals to me about Lloyds is the bank's simplified business model. It focuses on domestic retail and small business banking and is 100% UK-focused. Its cost-to-income ratio is low at 47.5% and the bank recently reported a strong Common Equity Tier 1 capital (CET1) of 13.4%.\nBarclays has a more complex business model, including an investment banking arm and more diverse geographic exposure. Many of its 'non-core' assets have underperformed of late, and as a result, the bank is looking to dispose of non-core holdings and simplify its group structure. Barclays recently reported a cost-to-income ratio of 79% for Q3, and a CET1 ratio of 11.6%.\nThere are still many risks facing the banking sector, however if I had to choose between Lloyds and Barclays, I would pick Lloyds on the back of its low price multiple, simplified structure and exciting dividend prospects.\nNeither Lloyds nor Barclays made this exclusive portfolio\nWhile Lloyds and Barclays may continue to perform well, neither stock made the cut when analysts at The Motley Fool put together the portfolio listed in this exclusive report:  Five stocks to retire on .\nThe report lists five high quality FTSE 100 holdings , all of which have superb long-term prospects according to the team at The Motley Fool. \nIf you're looking for core portfolio holdings to buy and keep, this report could be an excellent place to start.

That’s what Warren Buffett’s company paid, on average, to accumulate its stake in the iPhone maker, according to a recent regulatory filing that gives fresh details on the investment.\nThe company purchased 9.81 million shares of Apple in the days through March 14 for about $976 million, Berkshire’s Geico unit said in a document for insurance regulators.

Though the billionaire’s deputies may deviate from his well-known avoidance of technology stocks, they tend to follow his deeper ideas about investing, including buying stocks at prices where they believe there’s a “margin of safety” -- or a buffer against losses.\nWhen Berkshire bought Apple, the shares had slumped amid a slowdown in iPhone sales.

  "articleText" : "By Daniel Grote\n23 Feb, 2016\nUpdate: Shares in London Stock Exchange ( LSE ) have jumped on news it is resurrecting attempts to merge with German peer Deutsche Boerse (DB1Gn.DE).\nLSE raced to the top of the FTSE 100, up 12.3% at £26.00, as it said it was working on an all-share merger under a new holding company that would give its shareholders a 45.6% stake and Deutsche Boerse a 54.4% holding. The two exchanges previously attempted mergers in 2000 and 2004. \n'Since becoming publicly traded companies, most major stock exchanges have been trying to grow as fast as possible through acquisitions in order to attract the most trading volume,' said Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets.\n'Exchanges are paid on transaction and listing fees and want more trading volume to attract more fees. The bigger the exchange, the more trading volume and new listings, the greater the liquidity and that attracts more volume and listings.'\nThe surge in LSE shares, wasn't enough to lift the FTSE 100, which fell 70 points, or 1.2% to 5,967, with Standard Chartered ( STAN ) and miners extending their losses.\nBHP Billiton slashes dividend\n(10:12) BHP Billiton ( BLT ) has tumbled towards the bottom of the FTSE 100, after slashing its dividend as the commodities rout takes its toll on the miner.\nShares in the miner fell 3.4% to 767.8p and dragged down rivals. Antofagasta ( ANTO ) fell 3% to 502p, Anglo American ( AAL ) was down 2.4%at 472p, Glencore ( GLEN ) dropped 2.1% to 129.8p and Rio Tinto ( RIO ) traded 1.9% lower at £20.11. That weighed on the FTSE 100, which dropped 23 points, or 0.4%, to 6,013.\nBHP Billiton slashed its interim dividend by 75% to 16 cents, a much bigger cut than investors had been expecting, as it fell to its first loss in more than 16 years in the second half of 2015. The cut marks the abandonment of the miner's progressive dividend policy, but it committed to paying a minimum of half of its profits in dividends.\n'The changes to the dividend policy announced today reflect the board's assessment of the outlook for commodities and increased financial flexibility this demands,' said chairman Jac Nasser. 'While the continued development of emerging economies will underpin longer-term demand growth for commodities, we now believe the period of weaker prices and higher volatility will be prolonged.'\nSteve Clayton, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown said the change to BHP's dividend policy confirmed what the market already knew. 'A policy of paying continuously rising dividends only works for a commodity producer when the merry-go-round is spinning nicely,' he said. 'This policy is more realistic.'\nHe added that the new policy was likely to lead to less predictable dividends. 'Low production costs in the iron ore business should keep underlying cash flow positive, so there may be some scope to top up the base payout, as we saw at this interim stage,' he said.\n'But earnings are likely to be under pressure for some time and we would not expect a return to historic rates of dividend payments for the foreseeable future.'\nShares in Standard Chartered ( STAN ) were hit even harder, down 5.8% at 410.9p, as the emerging markets-focused bank announced an 84% fall in profits last year, in its worst results since 1998.\nShore Capital analyst Gary Greenwood said the results were 'even worse than we had expected'.\n'As anticipated, the outlook statement remains cautious with management noting that it expects financial performance during 2016 to remain subdued as it continues to execute on its turnaround strategy,' he said.\n'Accurately forecasting the numbers is therefore difficult in the near term, albeit we suspect the direction of travel is likely to be on the path of further downgrades due to top line weakness.'\nPersimmon ( PSN ) was the biggest riser on the index, up 4.5% at £20.62 after hiking the amount it plans to return to shareholders.\nThe house builder had planned to return £6.20 per share between 2012 and 2021, but has now raised that to £9, with a £1.10 payment scheduled for April.\n'Persimmon's enhanced capital return plan is a measure of the group's confidence in the future, and the prodigious cash flows that are being generated by the business,' said Charles Huggins, investment analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.\nThe news helped drag rival house builders higher. Barratt Developments ( BDEV ) was up 2.1% at 571.5p and Taylor Wimpey ( TW ) rose 1.1% to 177p.\nEmail a friend:\nLondon Stock Exchange jumps on Deutsche Boerse talks\nThere was an error sending your email.

REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann\nLONDON Commodities trader Glencore (GLEN.L) said on Thursday it recognises Libya's Tripoli-based National Oil Corp. (NOC) as the sole legal marketer of the country's oil, after securing an export deal earlier this year with the state-run company.\nThe Tripoli-based NOC has said it operates independently of either the rival government that controls the capital city or the internationally recognised government based in the east of the country, which earlier this year set up a separate NOC.\n\"International oil companies and the international community fully support NOC's position,\" said Alex Beard, head of oil at Glencore.\n\"They have made it very clear there is no alternative to the NOC at its legal address in Tripoli as the only recognised marketer of Libyan oil,\" he said in a statement.\nBloomberg reported last week the government in the east would prevent any tanker operated by Glencore from loading oil at Libyan ports if it did business with the Tripoli-based NOC.\nUnder the arrangement with the existing NOC, which began in September, Glencore loads and finds buyers for all the Sarir and Messla crude oil exported from the Marsa el-Hariga port near the country's eastern border with Egypt.\nWhile Libyan oil exports peaked at 1.6 million barrels per day, battles between rival factions seeking to control the country, as well as strikes and blockades by local tribes, have kept production under 0.5 million bpd for most of the past year.\nMustafa Sanalla, the chairman of the Tripoli-based NOC, on Thursday reiterated comments told to Reuters in an interview earlier this month, that Libya's oil partners and the international community fully backed the company, despite attempts by the recognised government in the east to set up a parallel oil payments system.\n\"The NOC, at its legal address in Tripoli, remains the only legally empowered oil contracting authority of the Libyan state,\" Sanalla said.\n\"It remains the seat of contracts for all the production, transportation and sale of Libyan oil.

Other transactions are in the works, including the sale of two small copper mines and Australian coal and rail assets.\nThe latest deal “shows continued asset disposals as promised, but perhaps a lower price than hoped,” Marc Elliott, a mining analyst at Investec Plc in London. His September research note on Glencore’s debt helped send the shares plunging 29 percent in one day.\n“They made bold plans which could be challenging to deliver, certainly in a bearish environment,” he said. \nThe agriculture deal yesterday valued the division at $6.25 billion, underwhelming some who had expected a higher amount. That could pressure Glencore to deliver more to meet its target of reducing net debt to as low as $17 billion, from $25.9 billion at the end of last year.\nThe company is confident of getting more than A$1 billion ($757 million) through the sale of its Australian coal train assets, which include nine locomotives, wagon and supporting equipment, a spokesman said last month. Earlier this week, its Kazakhstan mining unit sold a gold deposit for $100 million.\nAdditional Deals\n“We expect Glencore to sell its Lomas Bayas and Cobar copper mines for more than $1 billion,” while additional precious metals streaming and infrastructure deals are also possible, Jefferies LLC analysts including Christopher LaFemina said in a note Wednesday. While the divestment of a stake in the agriculture unit will strengthen Glencore’s balance sheet, “the sale price is somewhat disappointing,” the analysts said.\nGlencore’s Hong Kong-traded shares rose as much as 2.4 percent to HK$15.96 on Thursday and traded at HK$15.50 at 10:22 a.m. local time.\nRedemption Road\nThe deals are the road to redemption for the Swiss trader and miner after a wild 2015 with the stock plunging 70 percent to a record low and fears about its $30 billion debt pile as commodity prices collapsed. The market turmoil last year forced billionaire CEO Glasenberg to accept that some investors wanted the business better prepared for possible “\ndoomsday scenarios .”\nIn response, he outlined an aggressive plan to tackle the company’s debt by scrapping its dividend, selling assets and selling $2.5 billion in stock. Glencore has pledged to cut debt by as much as $9 billion this year.\nWhile Glencore’s London-listed shares have rallied more than 50 percent in 2016 on optimism over the debt-reduction plan and gains in metal prices, it’s still a long way from levels a year ago. The shares slipped 1.2 percent to 140.10 pence on Wednesday, valuing the company at about $28 billion.\n“The commodity-related companies are under a great deal of duress,” Peter Tague, co-head of M&A at Citigroup Inc., said in an interview with Bloomberg Television on Wednesday. “The need to delever is something that is primary among the focus in board rooms of all of the large commodity players.”\nPeter Grauer, chairman of Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, is a senior independent non-executive director at Glencore.\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

  "articleURL" : "http://www.economist.com/news/britain/21696915-last-better-news-britains-biggest-supermarket-tescos-return-profit-good-news",
  "articleText" : "purchase-rights icon\nSELDOM had a British company fallen quite so far, so fast. As recently as 2010 Tesco, the country’s biggest retailer, was riding high after years of relentless expansion, making pre-tax profits of £3.5 billion ($5.6 billion). Yet last year this same company lost £6.3 billion, by a stretch its own worst result ever and the sixth-largest loss in the country’s corporate history.\nSo the announcement on April 13th that Tesco has returned to profit, albeit a slender one, was great news, not only for the company itself but also for the rest of Britain’s struggling supermarkets. For the past few years Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons, the traditional top four, have been losing market share and pretty much everything else to the German-owned discounters Aldi and Lidl. Now, it seems, their position may be stabilising.\nTesco made a pre-tax profit of £162m in the year to February 27th on sales of £48.4 billion. It was the first time in three years that year-on-year sales had grown in Britain, by 0.9% in the fourth quarter, compared with a drop of 1.5% in the previous three months. None of these figures stack up against Tesco’s performance when it was in its pomp under Sir Terry Leahy, but they are a lot better than last year’s, and slightly ahead of expectations. The turnaround owes much to decisions taken by David Lewis, who became the ailing company’s chief executive 18 months ago.\nMost importantly, he has taken on Aldi and Lidl at their own game, lowering prices and cutting costs. In launching its own selection of cheap “Farm Foods”, for example, Tesco has cut the cost of an average shopping basket from £46.98 in August 2014 to £44.73. It has also reduced the number of products it sells.\nMr Lewis has shut 43 unprofitable stores and axed plans to open another 49 supermarkets, mostly the big out-of-town ones that consumers increasingly shun. The fleet of corporate jets has gone, and so have thousands of jobs. Mr Lewis has also been selling off businesses that Tesco accumulated over the years but no longer deems essential. Thus the supermarket’s South Korean Homeplus business was sold for £4.2 billion last year, its loss-making online video business, Blinkbox, went to TalkTalk and on April 12th Tesco sold half of its share in Lazada, an online retailer based in Singapore, to Alibaba, a vast Chinese firm. This raised another £90m. Others will go in due course.\nThe fact that Tesco’s share price actually fell on the news that it had returned to profit suggests that it is by no means out of intensive care, however. Mr Lewis himself warned that the retail market remains “challenging and uncertain”. Investors will want to see much more progress, albeit in roughly the same direction, before they relax. There will be no let-up in the competition from Aldi and Lidl, for one thing. The discounters are planning to open hundreds of new stores and Lidl, in particular, is targeting Tesco’s backyard in London and the south-east. Both Aldi and Lidl have been tweaking their own retail strategies, by offering more brands, for instance, and selling wine online, to entice Tesco’s more middle-class customers through their spruced-up doors.\nYet as Bryan Roberts, an analyst at TCC Global, a retail consultancy, argues, the Tesco results show that even if the British supermarkets cannot beat the discounters, at least they can come up with ways to co-exist with them successfully. Sainsbury’s has been fighting back by opening its own Netto discount stores. Cost-cutting Morrisons recently reported its first slight lift in sales for four years. The future may not be so bleak after all.\n",

Facebook At Work, a business version of Facebook, will be available to 100,000 staff across the bank to encourage collaboration and allow employees to communicate faster and more efficiently.  As well as using it on their desktop computers, employees will also be able to download it to their phones and tablets so that they can keep track of work when they are on the move.\nFacebook At Work will look and feel similar to the Facebook that people use every day and employees will be able to use all of the same features, allowing them to post photos, create groups and events, update their work profiles, and send private messages to colleagues.\nRBS has already piloted Facebook At Work and quickly found that staff were able to work much more efficiently together, answer customer questions faster, update other colleagues on their work in a much more engaging way and source a far wider range of ideas for on-going projects. Given how many people already use Facebook in their every day lives, it was picked up quickly by those on the pilot, with minimal training needed.\nFacebook At Work will be completely separate from personal Facebook accounts, meaning information shared between RBS employees is only accessible to other colleagues within the bank. Information shared on the site will be safe, secure and confidential.\nRBS began the pilot of Facebook At Work in July this year and it will be rolled out to 30,000 employees by end of March 2016. By the end of 2016 all employees will be using the tool.\nSimon McNamara, RBS Chief Administrative Officer said:\nâ€œIâ€™ve already been using Facebook At Work while we test it and itâ€™s been so useful â€“ allowing me to exchange information and ideas quickly and securely with all my team on a wide range of projects. Iâ€™m excited about how bringing people together from all across the bank through Facebook At Work can help our employees do their job better â€“ whether itâ€™s being able to find answers to customer queries much faster or helping us come up with bright new ideas.â€�\nCommenting, Sean Ryan, VP of Platform Partnerships from Facebook said:\n\"Facebook is a simple way for people to connect, share ideas and organise events. We hope Facebook At Work will help RBS, which employs 100,000 people, bring staff closer together and allow them to collaborate on projects much more effectively.\"\nPOSTED IN\n",

  "articleText" : "Are Aviva plc, Direct Line Insurance Group PLC And Admiral Group plc Set To Soar?\nBy Motley Fool | Tue, 3rd November 2015 - 09:48\nDirect Line (\nLSE\n:DLG) today reiterated its guidance for the full year, despite operating in a relatively competitive environment. Its full-year combined operating ratio is expected to be between 92% and 94%, with third quarter premiums having risen to £845m, up from £820m in the comparable period in 2014.\nUpbeat prospects\nEncouragingly, Direct Line's operating costs fell by 6.5% versus the third quarter of 2014, with claims handling expenses also dropping by 3.1%. Given the increasingly competitive nature of the car insurance market, as well as the softening of the home insurance market, such cost cuts are very timely as Direct Line seeks to obtain a prudent mix between volume growth and margin expansion.\nLooking ahead, Direct Line states that capital returns to its investors are dependent upon new rules in 2016 governing capital requirements. With the company's shares yielding 5% and trading on a price to earnings (\nP/E\n) ratio of 14.5, they appear to offer both good value for money now and upbeat income prospects for the long term.\nProgressing well\nSimilarly, Aviva (LSE:AV) also appears to be worth buying, with the company's merger with Friends Life progressing well according to its recent update. In fact, the value of its new business increased by 25% in the first nine months of the year, with cost savings of £91m having already being achieved from the merger. And, looking ahead, Aviva is seeking further acquisitions through which to increase its dominance of the insurance market.\nWhile Aviva's shares have disappointed in 2015, with them being flat year-to-date, much of this has been due to poor investor sentiment rather than lacklustre financial performance. However, with the merger integration proceeding as planned, it seems likely that the market will begin to warm to Aviva in the coming months and years. With its shares trading on a P/E ratio of 11.1 and yielding 4.3%, they appear to be well-worth buying right now.\nSupremely enticing\nMeanwhile, Admiral (LSE:ADM) continues to offer a supremely enticing yield of 5.9%, which makes it one of the highest yielding stocks in the\nFTSE 100\n. Certainly, there have been well-founded concerns regarding the company's ability to pay its forecast dividends, since they equate to almost all of its forecast earnings in each of the next two financial years. However, with Direct Line's results indicating that the outlook for the motor insurance industry may be brighter than previously thought, Admiral's profitability could be upgraded moving forward.\nWith Admiral's shares having risen by 23% since the turn of the year, they now trade on a P/E ratio of 16.3. Although this is higher than for a number of its sector peers, the prospect of improving market sentiment could push its rating higher. As such, it appears to still be worth buying at the present time.\nPeter Stephens owns shares of Admiral Group, Aviva, and Direct Line. The Motley Fool UK has no position in any of the shares mentioned. We Fools don't all hold the same opinions, but we all believe that considering a diverse range of insights makes us better investors.\n275294\n",

  "articleText" : "Tuesday 12 January 2016 07:58 BST\nRevival plan: Morrisons boss David Potts Toby Melville/Reuters\nThe City has piled into unfancied supermarket Morrisons and retailer Debenhams as the duo confounded their critics with much stronger-than-expected Christmas trading.\nBoth saw shares surge today: Morrisons was up 10% and Debenhams 16% as they caught the Square Mile off-guard with upbeat results.\nAnalysts had feared the worst for Morrisons — relegated from the FTSE 100 last year after a bitter price war — and department store chain Debenhams after downbeat updates from Next, Marks & Spencer and Sports Direct.\nBut the supermarket put in a rise in sales for the first time in four years, as chief executive David Potts said he cut back on in-store promotions, offered fewer multi-buy deals and improved pricing.\nIt left same-store sales up 0.2% in the nine weeks to January 3 — although nearly 1% of the boost to sales on last year came from the online operation and did not take into consideration the sell off last year of the convenience-store business.\nDiscounters Aldi and Lidl declared Christmas trading winners\nPotts said: “We are seeing customers coming in asking where things are and that’s a clue they haven’t been there before. I witnessed that up and down the country.\n“Some of our deals and marketing did attract more customers. We haven’t set out yet to welcome back customers to Morrisons… We need to make sure we’re right first. New customers are always willing to give stores a try.”\nBut despite the improvements, there was bad news for 680 staff as Potts said a further seven stores would close, in addition to the 20 shut last year.\nStaff were told on Tuesday, and Potts said no more shops are planned for closure.\n\"We are seeing customers coming in asking where things are and that’s a clue they haven’t been there before.\"\nMorrisons boss David Potts\nThe branches to be closed were not revealed until staff had been informed, but Potts said they were all smaller stores of around 15,000 square feet.\nInvestors were pleased with the performance and sent shares up nearly 10%, rising 15.2p to 167.5p, although analysts pointed out that the Kantar market data showed Morrisons down 2.6% once closures and the convenience-store sell off is considered.\nOver at Debenhams, outgoing chief executive Michael Sharp defied the market by revealing sales in the 19 weeks to January 9 rose 3.5% as he said the department store managed to avoid the pitfalls of the warm weather which affected rivals Marks & Spencer and Next.\nHe explained that the company focused more heavily on gift sales than in previous years, moving away from clothing. The retailer now sells fewer clothes than other goods.\nDebenhams sales rose 3.5% (Picture: PA)\nSharp added: “Over the course of the past few years we said we’d plan our sales more prudently with lower stock levels… That was about trying to make the business more flexible and we had less clothing stock than last year.”\nIt meant the retailer was not lumbered with too much warm clothing during one of the mildest Decembers on record. \nInvestors were impressed, with shares up 16%, or 10.55p to 76.55p.\nMore about:\n",

Meanwhile, the Asian operations are also showing signs of life.\"\nThe FTSE 100 index still closed with a 0.8 percent decline at 6,753.70 points, with the persistent threat of a Greek debt default holding back global equity markets.\nWithout a deal at the weekend to unlock frozen aid, Greece, which has received two bailouts worth 240 billion euros  ($268.85 billion) since 2010, is set to default on a June 30 repayment to the International Monetary Fund.\n\"The market is coming under pressure, but there is still a chance they will reach a last-minute agreement on Greece, as they have done in the past,\" said Dafydd Davies, partner at Charles Hanover Investments.\nEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said on Friday that he was \"quite optimistic but not over-optimistic\" of a cash-for-reform deal with Greece at a crucial meeting of euro zone finance ministers on Saturday.\nMining stocks took the most points off the FTSE, with the FTSE 350 Mining Index down 2.1 percent. Mining companies account for about a tenth of the FTSE 100.\nTraders said mining stocks fell because research firm Morningstar forecast steel demand in China -- the world's biggest metals consumer -- had peaked.

  "articleText" : "Tesco share price down as grocer faces SFO investigation outcome\nWatchdog expected to fine group up to Â£500m\nby Deyana Ivanova Tuesday, 26 Jan 2016, 08:37 GMT\nThe scale of Tescoâ€™s (LON:TSCO) accountancy scandal is expected to be laid out this week as the industry watchdog reports its findings, according to a senior city analyst.\nBritain's largest grocer has been the subject of a 16-month criminal inquiry by The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) into alleged overstatement of profits of Â£326 million, which led to the departure of several senior executives and contributed to Tesco reporting record quarterly losses last year. The watchdog has been looking into claims that payments made by suppliers to the chain were used to prop up profits.\nMike Dennis, an analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, expects the SFOâ€™s conclusion by the end of the week and warned there could be fines, forced repayments and restrictions imposed on Tesco. Dennis noted yesterday that the scope of the alleged fraud at the group might be far greater than had been revealed so far. He estimated that the amount Tesco collected from supplier payments rose by Â£1.7 billion over five years to Â£2.4 billion in February 2014 and accounted for 30 percent of cash profits.\nDennis added that the SFO could fine Tesco more than one percent of its UK grocery sales, or more over Â£350 million, and force the group to repay suppliers Â£100 million of cash payments over several years. Individual prosecutions of directors of the company involved and â€˜punitive finesâ€™ by the SFO could mean the total could be as much as Â£500 million.\nTescoâ€™s share price has risen by around five percent since an upbeat trading statement on 14 January, but has dropped by about a third since the accounting scandal broke in September 2014. Today the stock opened 0.87 percent lower at 154.30p. Despite the decline the grocer was outperforming the FTSE 100 index, which kicked off the session 1.33 percent down at 5,799.00  points.\n",

Orphan status is awarded to medicines promising benefits in the treatment of rare, life-threatening diseases, with the designation providing companies with incentives such as fast-track approvals and longer periods of market exclusivity.\nAstraZenecaâ€™s share price has advanced in todayâ€™s session, having added 2.13 percent to 4,173.50p as of 13:31 GMT. The gains are part of a broader market rally which has seen the blue-chip FTSE 100 index soar 2.41 percent to 6,008.52 points so far today.\nAstraZeneca announced in a statement today that the European Medicine Agencyâ€™s (EMA) Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products had adopted three positive opinions recommending acalabrutinib for designation as an orphan medicinal product. The opinions are for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma.\nâ€œTodayâ€™s three positive opinions recommending acalabrutinib for designation as an orphan medicinal product are important milestones,â€� Sean Bohen, chief medical officer at AstraZeneca, said in the statement, adding that they reinforced â€œthe strategic rationale for our investment in Acertaâ€�.\nAstraZeneca inked a deal to acquire a majority stake in Acerta at the end of last year for an upfront payment of $2.5 billion, and a further payment of $1.5 billion on receipt of the first regulatory approval foracalabrutinib for any indication in the US, or the end of 2018, depending on which occurs first.\nReuters notes that the Anglo-Swedish group believes that the drug could generate sales of more than $5 billion a year, while analysts at HSBC said last month that acalabrutinib could prove to be a â€˜best-in-classâ€™ monotherapy, which justified the price for acquiring a company whose main asset had not yet been approved.\nAcalabrutinibâ€™s orphan drug status now needs to be endorsed by the European Commission which typically follows the recommendations of EMAâ€™s committees.\n",

Having rolled out single serve Fruit Shoot packages it said its move into the bigger U.S. take-home market would come in 2016 rather than 2015.\nBritvic said that while it expected challenging trading conditions to persist it remained on track to post a 2015 operating profit of between 164 million and 173 million pounds, up from 158 million in 2014.\n(Reporting by Neil Maidment, Editing by Paul Sandle)\nNext In Business News\n",

  "articleText" : "Market News | Thu Feb 5, 2015 | 5:50am EST\nOil majors fail to find reserves to counter falling output\n* Oil groups produced much more than they found last year\n* Oil and gas output fell in 2014, echoes trend over past decade\n* Graphic on oil majors' output: link.reuters.com/huh93w\n* Companies now making investment cuts to counter low oil prices\nBy Tom Bergin and Ron Bousso\nLONDON, Feb 5 Big oil companies had a poor record of finding and producing oil and gas last year, according to figures out in the past week - and big cuts in spending in response to falling crude prices could undermine their plans to turn that around.\nFour of the world's six biggest oil firms by market value - Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron, BP and ConocoPhillips - released provisional figures showing together they replaced only two-thirds of the hydrocarbons they extracted in 2014 with new reserves.\nCombined, those four and industry leader Exxon Mobil  posted an average drop in oil and gas production of 3.25 percent last year.\nAll predict their output will increase and new reserves will be added in coming years. But the 2014 results echo longer-term trends.\nOver the past decade, the biggest Western oil companies have seen reserves growth stall, production drop 15 percent and profits fall by almost a fifth - even as oil prices almost doubled, a Reuters analysis of corporate filings shows.\nAnalysts and industry executives have blamed the sector's anaemic performance in that period, in part, on companies' approach to spending on new fields and infrastructure, tending to ramp it up when oil prices rise and cut when prices plummet, such as in the late 1990s and after the 2008 financial crisis.\nThe latest collapse has seen prices halve since June. In recent months, the biggest oil groups on both sides of the Atlantic have announced sharp cuts in capital expenditure (capex) out as far as 2017, as they seek to preserve cash to maintain dividends.\nInvestors have largely welcomed the focus on dividends. But some say the cuts could come back to bite the industry.\n\"Capex can't be cut forever. Cuts in capex are only storing up problems for the sector down the road,\" said Will Riley, fund manager with the Guinness Global Energy Fund, which holds shares in many of the big U.S. and European oil firms.\nThe ability of oil companies to replace reserves has not been as much of a concern for some executives and investors in recent years due to the shale oil boom.\nBut the high cost of extracting shale oil makes doing so profitably a challenge where prices are low - making traditional and less expensive reserves more relevant in a downturn.\nLOST OPPORTUNITIES\nBP and Chevron have announced around 13 percent cuts in capex for 2015, while ConocoPhillips last week upped its planned reductions in spending for 2015 to 33 percent. Shell and Exxon have not issued budget plans yet.\n\"We have to prioritise cash flow instead of growth for the time being,\" Gerhard Roiss, chief executive of Vienna-based oil producer OMV AG, said last week as he announced an around 30 percent reduction in investment in new projects.\nOil executives play down worries about the sector's fundamental health. They say lower production reflects an increased focus on returns, rather than output for its own sake, while falling reserves figures can be misleading.\n\"These (2014) reserve replacement numbers are a little lumpy ... I am not too alarmed about this year's down(turn),\" BP boss Bob Dudley told reporters this week.\nHowever, even executives accept that excessive pruning of investments can cost them barrels and profits in the long term.\n\"Many of the things that you may do out of excessive prudence basically means that you lose them (the opportunities). They won't come back anymore,\" Shell CEO Ben van Buerden told investors last week.\nVan Buerden said he would cut less than rivals to ensure he did not crimp Shell's long-term prospects. Similarly, Exxon told investors on Monday that while it would monitor spending closely, it would not \"forego any attractive opportunities\".\nNonetheless, Shell has shelved projects and put off $15 billion of spending it might have committed to over the next three years. Analysts at Jefferies predict Exxon will announce a 13 percent drop in capex when it presents its strategy plans in March.\nMartijn Rats, head of oil companies research at Morgan Stanley in London, said in a research note this week that overly aggressive cuts could have long-term repercussions.\nThe expertise needed to develop new fields and infrastructure takes long periods to build up, he said. Hence, if companies lose this expertise, they may struggle to expand their portfolios when oil prices recover.\nDEPLETION\nExecutives say the risk is not only that companies may lose future growth opportunities but also that existing reserves may not be fully exploited.\nProduction from oil fields falls over time, because reservoir pressure drops as oil is extracted. Fields on average experience natural depletion rates of around 15 percent per year, industry executives say, but companies generally reduce this to 3-5 percent by sinking additional wells, injecting gas or by using other capital-intensive techniques.\nCutting capex will increase depletion rates, if past experience is an indicator.\n\"That is a growing risk for the industry. If you go back to the 2008 and 2009 period ... we saw an increase worldwide in decline rates for all companies, basically for the entire industry, increase by a percent or two. And that's very significant,\" Chevron CEO John Watson told investors last week.\nUsing data going back to the oil drop in the mid 1980s, analysts at Bernstein calculated the rise in depletion rates was 3 percentage points within two years after an oil price collapse began.\nAcross the industry, this could mean the loss of hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil production each day.\nSome investors and analysts say companies could yet use the downturn to help build long-term reserves and production.\nPaul Mumford, fund manager with Cavendish Asset Management, said lower oil prices and a drop in drilling activity was leading to downward pressure on the prices firms which sell construction and drilling services to oil majors charge. This could encourage some companies to drill and build more, he said.\nAnd Charles Whall, fund manager with Investec, said stronger companies should consider replacing reserves through acquisitions.\nMorgan Stanley's Rats added: \"Sometimes, the best projects are done at the bottom of the cycle.\"\n(Additional reporting by Dmitry Zhdannikov; Editing by Pravin Char)\nNext In Market News\n",

While his takeover of the Giraffe restaurant chain always seemed an unnecessary distraction from the struggling core grocery business, he did do other, cannier deals – notably, Tesco’s partnership with the posh Euphorium Bakery group.\nThe difference between the two transactions is plain. Giraffe was bought in what seemed a desperate bid to use up space in Tesco’s out-of-town and out-of-touch hypermarkets. There was scarce natural crossover with the stores themselves.\nEuphorium, on the other hand, fitted perfectly in-store immediately, with its sour doughs and artisan breads complementing Tesco’s cheaper bakery goods.\nIt has proved particularly popular in the posher corners of the country, offering differentiation from Aldi and Lidl for wealthier shoppers.\nRead more\nAfter a yoga class or a coffee? Pop into Tesco\nNow, despite Tesco’s new boss, Dave Lewis, pulling the plug on many of the non-core businesses, he’s decided to buy out Euphorium completely.\nWhile the deal is small potatoes for a business the size of Tesco, the City has rightly welcomed it as proof that Mr Lewis is taking a measured approach to fixing the business he inherited.\nMeanwhile, the Euphorium founder Danny Bear, who set up the business in 1999 with a single bakery in the Labour-luvvie heartland of Islington, walks away with his pockets stuffed full of Tesco’s bread.

He was released later in the day following a court hearing.\nMcClatchey's lawyer, Steven Kartagener, declined to comment. An attorney for Pusey, 47, did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe charges were announced by Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, who has overseen an insider trading crackdown that has resulted in 102 people being charged and 78 being convicted since 2009.\nThat push has suffered recent setbacks following a 2014 appellate ruling that limited the scope of insider trading laws, resulting in charges being dropped or dismissed against 14 defendants.\nAccording to the complaint and a related U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit filed on Tuesday, McClatchey was responsible for tracking all potential deals involving the bank.\nHe began tipping Pusey, a friend he met through boating, as early as 2013, enabling the plumber to execute trades ahead of merger announcements involving 11 companies, including Forest Oil Corp and PetSmart Inc.\nIn exchange, Pusey paid thousands of dollars in cash to McClatchey, sometimes placing cash in a gym bag that McClatchey brought with him to a marina in Freeport, New York, and provided free bathroom remodeling services, authorities said.\nWhile Barclays was not identified by name in court papers, the bank confirmed it was the British investment bank that had employed McClatchey.\nIn a statement, Barclays said it has cooperated fully with authorities, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the SEC \"since learning about this incident involving a former employee.\"\nThe cases in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, are U.S. v.

REUTERS/Luke MacGregor\nBy Ben Hirschler | LONDON\nLONDON GlaxoSmithKline is banking on a major clinical trial to revive its flagging respiratory medicine business, with billions of dollars of sales riding on a positive result.\nData from the so-called SUMMIT study, designed to show GSK's Breo can prolong lives of patients with chronic lung disease, are expected as early as next month, nine years after a similar study with GSK's older drug Advair failed by a whisker.\nThis time GSK reckons it has a better chance, since the new trial, with 16,500 patients, has more statistical power than the 6,100-patient Advair trial, known as TORCH. GSK has also chosen higher-risk patients with heart issues for the new study.\nAt present, inhaled drugs such as Breo that combine a steroid and a long-acting beta agonist (LABA) are known to help patients breath more easily but their effect on survival is unclear.\nIf it succeeds, Breo would be the first drug to show a survival benefit in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), potentially turning around its fortunes.\nWhile Breo was approved for COPD in 2013 and won a U.S. green light for asthma in April, it has been slow to take off commercially.\nSometimes known as \"son of Advair\", once-a-day Breo has a dosing advantage over twice-daily Advair. But the market for inhaled lung drugs is fiercely competitive and Breo has struggled at a time when GSK has been forced to cut Advair prices.\nHSBC analyst Stephen McGarry thinks Breo could eventually achieve peak annual sales of $5.0 billion if SUMMIT succeeds, or $1.8 billion if it fails.\nOther analysts are more cautious and the current consensus is for sales of $1.55 billion in 2020, according to Thomson Reuters Cortellis.\nGSK's partner Theravance is entitled to royalties of 15 percent on the first $3 billion of annual sales and 5 percent beyond that. \nBritain's GSK has been a world leader in respiratory medicine since launching the Ventolin inhaler back in 1969, but weak sales in recent quarters are a mounting concern for its investors.\nCourtney Crimm, a pulmonologist who oversees the SUMMIT trial at GSK, believes a successful result would oblige doctors to rethink prescribing strategies.\n\"If this study is positive, it could lead to a paradigm shift,\" he told Reuters, noting that 50 to 70 percent of COPD patients also have cardiovascular risk factors.\nFurthermore, because SUMMIT recruited patients with \"moderate\" COPD it might prompt wider use of the medicine in patients with less severe breathing difficulties, he said.\nCurrent medical guidelines recommend steroid and LABA combinations only for people with more severe breathing problems. Those who are less seriously affected are often given an alternative drug such as Pfizer and Boehringer Ingelheim's Spiriva.\n(Editing by Mark Potter)\n",

The performance of the business, which supplies materials to commercial clients and small builders as well as DIY-ers, is seen as a key indicator of the housing market.\nTravis Perkins also continued to expand, opening 53 new branches and stores last year through its 21 businesses, including Wickes, BSS and Tile Giant.\nJohn Carter, chief executive, said: “The group has delivered a good performance in 2015 despite the weaker than expected RMI market in the second half of the year.”\nShares in the company were up 3.4pc in early trading this morning.\nFollow Telegraph Business\n",

  "articleText" : "Business News | Wed Jul 22, 2015 | 4:06pm BST\nBeach holiday demand helps lift clouds for easyJet\nBy Sarah Young | LONDON\nLONDON British low-cost airline easyJet (EZJ.L) forecast annual profit growth of up to 14 percent, helped by higher demand for beach holidays which calmed fears it had raised over its outlook.\nRevenue performance in the three months to the end of June was better than easyJet had forecast in May, boosted by increased demand for flights to southern European resorts such as Malaga, Alicante and Faro from northern Europe, and Britain in particular.\nShares in easyJet, Europe's second biggest budget airline after Ryanair (RYA.I), gained 4.3 percent to 1,739 pence at 0840 GMT (0940 BST), their highest level since mid-May.\nThe strength of the pound against the euro is making holidays on the continent particularly appealing for Britons this year. The euro hit a 7-1/2-year low against the pound last Friday EURGBP=D4, having shed around 10 percent against the currency since the start of the year.\nEasyJet did, however, warn that it faced a series of uncertainties in future given the crisis in Greece, a bloody attack on tourists in Tunisia, the impact of a fire at Fiumicino airport in Rome and various threats of industrial action.\nDespite these uncertainties, it forecast  profit growth of between 7 percent and 14 percent for the year to the end of September, putting it on track to meet analyst forecasts for a 10 percent rise.\nThe company's warning over revenue per seat in May had dragged on the stock. Before Wednesday, easyJet shares had fallen 9 percent since the statement in mid-May compared to a 10 percent rise in Ryanair's stock.\nThe divergent performances reflect concerns about Ryanair's move into what has traditionally been easyJet's territory, after the Irish carrier polished up its image and started adding more main city airports to its routes.\nBut some analysts believe those fears are overdone. Ryanair and easyJet compete directly on less than 5 percent of routes, and easyJet is years ahead of Ryanair in having built a network based on so-called primary airports closer to large cities.\nThe easyJet strategy would help it continue to win in what it called a \"more competitive market,\" the company said.\nAnalysts said investors would be relieved by this latest  update from easyJet.\n\"With all the concerns that the market has had about excess capacity in the market and the likely impact on yields, we believe that these results will be well received,\" Numis analyst Wynn Ellis said, referring to yield, a measure of pricing per passenger.\n(Reporting by Sarah Young; editing by Kate Holton and Keith Weir)\nAn EasyJet aircraft takes off past the air traffic control tower of Pablo Ruiz Picasso Airport on the first day of a series of strikes by Spanish air traffic controllers, in Malaga, southern Spain, June 8, 2015.

(ICE) on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) March 1, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n1/2\nleft\nright\nA man walks past the London Stock Exchange in the City of London October 11, 2013. REUTERS/Stefan Wermuth\n2/2\nBy Noor Zainab Hussain , Esha Vaish and John McCrank\nNew York Stock Exchange owner ICE (ICE.N) said it may make a rival bid for London Stock Exchange (LSE.L), raising the prospect of a takeover battle with Deutsche Boerse (DB1Gn.DE) and lifting LSE shares to a record high on Tuesday.\nThe announcement by Intercontinental Exchange Inc is the latest development in a long string of mergers, bidding wars and failed deals among global exchanges.\nThe industry has been trying to consolidate for years amid weaker trading volumes and shrinking margins. Instead of stock trading, the exchanges have focused on more profitable businesses, such as derivatives trading and selling market data.\nBut regulatory concerns about the concentration of power in the hands of a few exchanges, along with nationalist wrangling, have hindered many cross-border deals.\nLSE Chief Executive Xavier Rolet has been one of the most vocal advocates of consolidation. In December he laid out his vision of global exchange consolidation, saying he expected three to five \"exchange powerhouses\" in North America, Europe and Asia.\nWhether ICE will follow through with a bid for LSE is not certain. The Atlanta-based exchange said it had not yet approached LSE and may not pursue a deal at all. Nonetheless, news of its interest pushed up share prices of exchanges across Europe.\nWhile Deutsche Boerse is interested in combining with LSE to create a full-service trading powerhouse, analysts said, ICE's interest likely relates to two of LSE's businesses: Clearing and market data. After acquiring NYSE in 2013, ICE kept the New York Stock Exchange and its mainly European-focused derivatives unit, Liffe, but sold off other substantial parts of NYSE's business.\nICE had attempted in 2010 to buy NYSE together with Nasdaq Inc (NDAQ.O). The two exchanges placed a bid to rival Deutsche Borse's, when the German exchange attempted to buy the Big Board. Regulatory concerns ultimately foiled both Deutsche Borse's and Nasdaq's attempts.\nThose concerns still carry relevance today.\nLSE and Deutsche Boerse are already walking a political tight-rope between London and Frankfurt as they hammer out terms of their agreed merger. Political and regulatory demands may be even more strenuous if a non-European exchange tries to buy LSE.\nCME Group (CME.O) is actively considering doing so, people familiar with the matter said. Analysts suggested that Euronext NV (ENX.PA) and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (0388.HK) may also be interested. All three declined to comment.\n\"It's going to force anybody that has been potentially looking at (LSE) to step up or go away,\" said Numis Securities analyst Jonathan Goslin.\nA RICHER OFFER?\nThe proposed tie-up of Deutsche Boerse and LSE, which was announced last week, would be an all-stock merger. It would give  Deutsche Boerse shareholders a 54.4 percent stake in the new company. However, rival bidders could force Deutsche Boerse to offer a bigger premium or bow out.\nDeutsche Boerse said it had seen ICE's statement but indicated it was not looking to alter its proposed offer, while LSE confirmed it had not received a proposal from ICE.     \"The company is continuing its merger talks with LSE with no change,\" Deutsche Boerse said in a statement.\nSources familiar with the proposed tie-up said the pair are betting that they stand a stronger chance of winning approval from European governments and regulators, than if a U.S. operator were involved.\n\"Deutsche Boerse and LSE are banking on political backing from Brussels, Berlin and probably also London for a 'European deal' that might support the planned EU capital markets union,\" one source said.\nThe source said Rolet still has faith in the Deutsche Boerse deal, even if a rival comes through with a richer offer, although analysts said an all-cash deal would be difficult to turn down.\n\"Our suspicion is that ICE or CME will derail the Deutsche-Boerse-LSE love affair only by offering cash,\" independent research firm AlphaValue said in a note to clients.\nShares of LSE, which had a market value of $13 billion at Monday's close, rose as much as 9 percent to 2,918 pence.\nICE shares were down about 3 percent at $231.26 in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while shares of CME Group Inc (CME.O) were up 1 percent at $92.38 on the Nasdaq.\nThe German company's shares ended regular trading at 76.87 euros, up 0.9 percent.\nICE must make an offer for LSE no later than March 29. Under British takeover rules, Deutsche Boerse must either make a formal offer or announce it will not do so by March 22, unless it gets an extension from the UK mergers regulator. Rolet plans to retire if LSE's planned merger with its German rival goes ahead.\n(Additional reporting by Jonathan Gould and Andreas Kroener in Frankfurt and Anjuli Davies in London; Writing by Rachel Armstrong and Lauren Tara LaCapra; Editing by Savio D'Souza, Alexander Smith and Steve Orlofsky)\nNext In Deals\n",

  "articleText" : "Money News | Tue Nov 3, 2015 | 11:51pm IST\nStanChart to axe 15,000 jobs and raise $5.1 bln in turnaround plan\nBy Lawrence White and Steve Slater | HONG KONG/LONDON\nHONG KONG/LONDON Standard Chartered plans to axe 15,000 jobs and raise $5.1 billion by selling new shares as its new chief executive set out a plan to restore profitability after three years of falling profits and strategic mistakes.\nThe bank, regarded as one of the 30 most important in the world, will cut 17 percent of its workforce to help save $2.9 billion by 2018, and sell or restructure $100 billion of loans, or a third of its total.\nCEO Bill Winters, a former JPMorgan investment bank boss who took the helm of Standard Chartered in June, described the move as an \"aggressive and decisive set of actions\" to shore up the bank, which makes two-thirds of its profits in Asia.\nWinters is one of a handful of new European bank CEOs - including at Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and Barclays - who must push through big restructuring plans to cut costs and improve profitability in the face of a tougher regulatory landscape, which has made many banking activities unprofitable.\nStandard Chartered's problems were laid bare by news of a third-quarter operating loss of $139 million, weighed down by growing global regulatory costs and rising losses on loans in India. Revenue slumped 18 percent year-on-year.\nIt was the fifth successive quarter of falling revenue for the bank. Before the results, analysts had expected it to report a $2.9 billion profit this year, compared to $7.5 billion in 2012 - the year when many of its troubles began.\nThe bank was fined $667 million that year for breaking U.S.  sanctions related to Iran, and New York's powerful banking regulator called it a \"rogue institution\". More trouble followed related to strategy, execution and governance, and previous CEO Peter Sands was ousted and replaced by Winters.\nStandard Chartered remains under investigation. Winters said Britain's Financial Conduct Authority has two open probes into the bank's monitoring of sanctions and anti-money laundering compliance.\nU.S. authorities are also still investigating transactions involving Iranian clients, including whether the bank still had Iran relationships when it signed its 2012 settlement.\nIts London-listed shares were down 8.9 percent at 650.4 pence by 1141 GMT, the worst-performing stock on the European bank index. They have slumped 32 percent this year, partly due to expectations Winters would launch a rights issue and also on the Asian slowdown.\nMajor shareholders welcomed the moves to arrest the slide.\n\"Standard Chartered’s management is taking the right steps to address the bank’s problems. The plan outlined seems sensible and it is clear where the bank now wishes to focus its business,\" said Hugh Young, managing director of Aberdeen Asset Management Asia.\nAberdeen is the bank's second biggest shareholder with a near 9 percent stake, and Young said it would support the rights issue. Singapore investment company Temasek, the bank's top shareholder, said it intends to take up its full allocation of the issue, representing 15.8 percent of shares.\nSTAYING IN LONDON\nThe rights issue, StanChart's first capital-raising in five years, will be launched on Tuesday at a price of 465 pence per share, a 35 percent discount to its last traded price in London. Two new shares will be issued for every seven existing shares.\n\"Post restructuring and recapitalisation Standard Chartered will be a stronger and more focused group. But the group will remain a complicated work-in-progress during the upcoming years,\" said Ronit Ghose, analyst at Citi.\nWinters said he had no plans to add to that complexity by considering moving headquarters away from London. Its rival HSBC is considering relocating.\n\"It's absolutely not a priority for us right now. We have an enormous execution agenda and we find the UK to be a very pragmatic and predictable place to do business,\" Winters told reporters on a conference call.\nStandard Chartered said it would not pay a final dividend for this year, saving the company $700 million.\nThe capital-raising and asset-restructuring will together push the bank towards a new common equity tier-1 capital (CET1) ratio goal of 12-13 percent, according to the company.\nThe bank's current CET1 ratio - a measure of financial strength - dipped to 11.4 percent at the end of September and will rise to 13.1 percent after the rights issue.\nAnalysts had expected Winters would wait until after Bank of England stress test on Dec. 1 before announcing a rights issue. The bank said the regulator was aware of the bank's plans and had not objected.\nStandard Chartered has already cut 4,000 staff this year, and Winters said about 1,000 senior staff, or a quarter of the top ranks, had already been told they would go. He said he hoped most other cuts would be made in areas where there was a high natural attrition.\nThe sale or restructuring of $100 billion of risk-weighted assets includes $20 billion of big loans to individual borrowers that Winters said were outside the bank's \"risk tolerance\" and would be liquidated.\nHe plans to further restructure the troubled business in Korea, reposition its activities in Indonesia and shed assets in commercial and investment banking. The bank will also reduce its retail operations in second and third-tier cities where it currently has a presence.\nThe restructuring will cost $3 billion and Winters said he also plans to invest more than $1 billion over three years to improve its retail and private banking business, Africa, and to enhance controls.\n(Additional reporting by Denny Thomas and Umesh Desai; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman, Pravin Char and Giles Elgood)\nA man walks past the head office of Standard Chartered bank in the City of London February 27, 2015.

  "articleText" : "BT Group's third quarter revenues rise as restructure unveiled\nMon, 01 February 2016\nChg %: 0.21%\nDate: 17:04\n(ShareCast News) - BT Group's third quarter revenues have risen 3%, leaving the company's year-to-date revenues flat.\nIn a results released on Monday, the company said revenue for the three months to 31 December 2015 was £4.59bn, with revenue for the nine months at £13.25bn.\nReported profit before tax also rose 24% for the quarter, up to £862m, and year to date profit up 18% to £2.14bn.\nChief executive Gavin Patterson said it was a strong set of results.\n\"BT Consumer had a standout quarter, increasing its overall line base for the first time in well over a decade and capturing 71% of new broadband customers.\n\"Good customer growth in broadband, TV and mobile helped to grow ARPU by 7%,\" he said\nPatterson also highlighted BT Global Services also did well with good revenue growth in continental Europe and Asia.\nHe said Openreach is also doing well. \"Fibre is underpinning the growth at Openreach with almost half a million premises taking up the service this quarter via dozens of service providers.\n\"The fibre market is highly competitive and growing all the time, which is great news for the UK economy.\"\nThe FTSE 100 company also announced a new organisational structure following the acquisition of EE, a brand which it said will be retained.\nIt will see the business focus on six lines of business - Consumer, EE, Business and Public Sector, Global Services, Wholesale and Ventures, Openreach.\nAll six divisions will be supported by BT's Technology, Service and Operations, which is currently responsible for BT's 'core' networks in the UK and overseas, its IT platforms and its global Research and Development arm.\nConsumer will focus on broadband, telephony, TV and mobile services, while EE will focus largely on the consumer market, retaining its brand, its network and its hundreds of high street stores.\nThe Business and Public Sector, which is a new division with around £5bn of revenues will be comprised of the existing BT Business along with EE's business division and parts of BT Global Services that are UK focused.\nWholesale and Ventures will be expanded to include EE's mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) business as well as some specialist businesses such as Fleet, Payphones and Directories.\nOpenreach is unaffected in the restructure. Patterson said the acquisition of EE provides BT Group with a chance to refresh its structure.\n\"We have done that by creating a major new division that will focus on businesses and the public sector in the UK and Ireland.\n\"We want to support those sectors by offering customers the very best services whether that be dedicated private lines, network products such as fibre broadband, mobile solutions, IT services or cyber expertise to keep them safe.\"\nThe changes take effect from April.\n",

  "articleText" : "SSE share price: Peterhead station to supply voltage support to National Grid\nDeal is positive news for Peterhead, says managing director\nby Michael Catchpole Monday, 23 Mar 2015, 15:00 GMT\nSSE Plcâ€™s (LON:SSE) gas-powered station located in Peterhead, Aberdeenshire will begin providing voltage support services to National Grid (LON:NG) between April 2016 and September 2017. The Â£15 million contract will see the station provide voltage control, the method which National Grid uses to ensure that the electricity system stays within its set daily limits.\nNational Grid will be able to call on 385 megawatts (MW) of Peterhead stationâ€™s 1180MW capacity, if required, as part of the deal.\nThe SSE Peterhead gas station was chosen by National Grid after a competitive tendering process. Jim Smith, managing director of energy portfolio management at SSE, said that the deal is â€œpositive news for Peterhead.â€� He went on to explain that SSE has continually invested in the station since it opened in 1980 and that the company is pleased over the contract between themselves and National Grid.\nSSEâ€™s share price hit a high of 1,564p at 10:18 GMT today before easing to 1,551p by 11:27 GMT. Meanwhile, National Gridâ€™s share price dropped to 882p.\nThe latest corporate development follows last Wednesdayâ€™s news that SSE had paid Â£100,000 for breaching a payments system designed to prevent electricity generators from exploiting the market and charging excessive prices. It was revealed that SSE had submitted increased offers to National Grid in January 2014 to reduce generation at six of its Scottish hydro-electric power stations, due to a flood risk at the dams. Instead, SSE kept the level for a sustained period of time, resulting in National Grid paying more than it should have done to reduce generation from the stations.\nSSE Plc also announced on the same day that company Chairman Lord Robert Smith of Kelvin had brought forward his departure from the company to become chairman of IMI Plc (LON:IMI). He is now expected to leave SSE by the end of the companyâ€™s Annual General Meeting on 23 July, 2015.\n",

REUTERS/Jim Young\nBy Jonathan Stempel\nWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) is seeking permission from the Federal Reserve to increase its ownership stake in Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), after reaching the 10 percent level that could prompt increased regulatory scrutiny.\nAccording to papers obtained by Reuters on Friday, Berkshire said it learned in mid-March that its Wells Fargo stake, including 2.01 million shares held by Buffett, had reached 10.01 percent because of buybacks by the San Francisco-based bank, which decreased the number of shares outstanding.\nThough the stake later dipped to 9.97 percent, Berkshire said it has again risen above 10 percent because of more buybacks by Wells, which is the third-largest U.S. bank by assets. Berkshire said it has bought no Wells Fargo shares since Oct. 21.\n\"Berkshire is seeking permission to retain its current ownership position in Wells Fargo and to acquire additional shares of common stock of Wells Fargo for investment purposes,\" according to the papers, which were dated June 14 and submitted to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.\nThe Federal Reserve exerts special oversight when investors take large bank stakes.\nBerkshire said it had no dollar value in mind for purchases, had no plans to make significant changes to Wells Fargo's strategy or corporate structure, and was not contemplating changes to the bank's management or board.\nBloomberg News earlier reported the paperwork.\nBerkshire's investment in Wells Fargo is worth more than $23 billion.\n\"We value Berkshire Hathaway as a long-term shareholder and customer, and we appreciate the confidence that Berkshire’s executive team has shown,\" Wells Fargo spokesman Ancel Martinez said an email.\nBuffett has long been a supporter of Wells Fargo, calling it \"very well run\" and a \"terrific operation,\" and saying that Chief Executive John Stumpf has done a \"fabulous job.\"\nThe Federal Reserve exerts special oversight when investors take large bank stakes.\nIn a September 2008 policy statement, the Fed said it often lets investors take double-digit stakes not designed to exert a \"controlling influence,\" but would review any resulting business relationships \"case-by-case.\"\nThe U.S. Treasury Department has said it will not deem a 10 percent stake to result in \"control\" of a big bank if an investor agrees in writing to limits on its involvement.\nBerkshire also owns 15.94 percent of American Express Co (AXP.N), the application and Reuters data show.\nBased in Omaha, Nebraska, Berkshire also operates close to 90 businesses such as auto insurer Geico, the BNSF railroad, Dairy Queen ice cream and various apparel, energy and industrial companies.\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Marguerita Choy and Leslie Adler)\nNext In Money\n",

  "articleText" : "LONDON (Alliance News) - The following is a summary of top news stories Tuesday.\n----------\nCOMPANIES\n----------\nBarclays reported an increase in adjusted pretax profit last year, but the group's earnings on a statutory basis were dragged down by a provisions over alleged foreign exchange manipulation, insurance mis-sold to customers in the UK, and a technical change in the valuation of a portfolio of loans held in its non-core unit. Barclays beat analyst forecasts by reporting a 12% increase in adjusted pretax profit, which amounted to GBP5.50 billion in 2014. Analysts had forecast a GBP5.33 billion adjusted pretax profit, according to Barclays. On a statutory basis, pretax profit fell to GBP2.26 billion from GBP2.87 billion. The bank swung to a net loss of GBP174 million, compared with a GBP540 million net profit in the prior year.\n----------\nMetals and mining giant Glencore joined sector peers in slashing its capital expenditure plans, after it reported lower 2014 profits hit by the fall in the oil price and prices for other commodities. In a statement, the company said its capital expenditure fell to USD8.57 billion in 2014, from a pro-forma USD1132 billion in 2013, and it now expects total industrial capital expenditure for 2015 to be between USD6.5 billion and USD6.8 billion, down from its previous guidance of USD7.9 billion. The company will pay a final cash distribution of USD12 cents a share, up 9% on the year.\n----------\nBritish American Tobacco said its Brazilian unit British American Tobacco Prestação de Serviços Ltda has filed a request with the Brazilian securities regulator to register a public tender offer to acquire up to all of the 24.7% of Souza Cruz shares which are not currently owned by BAT and to delist the company.\n----------\nTaylor Wimpey joined sector peers in reporting strong growth in 2014 profits driven by higher home completions at higher average selling prices, and it was also positive about its outlook saying the so-called \"spring selling season\" has got off to a better start than it had expected. The home builder reported a pretax profit of GBP468.8 million for 2014, up from GBP306.2 million in 2013, as revenue rose to GBP2.69 billion, from GBP2.30 billion. It raised its total maintenance dividend for 2014 to 1.56 pence from 0.69p in 2013, including a final dividend of 1.32p, up from 0.47p.\n----------\nDirect Line Insurance Group warned that the UK motor and home insurance markets are still highly competitive, with the opening months of the new year showing signs of more pressure in motor and \"broad stability\" in the home market. The group's update came within annual results showing that pretax profit for continuing operations rose to GBP456.8 million in 2014, compared with GBP407.3 million in the prior year. Operating profit from ongoing operations crept down to GBP506.0 million from GBP509.9 million. Direct Line increased its total dividend for 2014 to 27.2 pence from 20.6 pence in 2013.\n----------\nAshtead Group said it now expects its full-year results will be above its previous expectations, after it reported strong growth in third-quarter earnings driven by strong revenue growth in both its US and UK operations. The equipment rental company reported a pretax profit of GBP109.9 million for the three months to January 31, the third quarter of its financial year, up from GBP77.9 million a year earlier, as revenue rose to GBP512.9 million, from GBP400.1 million.\n----------\nTravis Perkins reported higher pretax profit and revenue for 2014 as the continued recovery in the UK housing market drove good revenue growth in its general merchanting and contracts divisions, although profit growth was held back partly by restructuring costs for its plumbing and heating business. The company reported a pretax profit of GBP321.4 million for 2014, up from GBP312.6 million in 2013, even though revenue grew strongly to GBP5.58 billion from GBP5.15 billion.\n----------\nPace expressed confidence in making \"further progress\" in 2015, saying it expects earnings to rise, as it posted a increase in pretax profit for 2014. The maker of products such as set-top boxes for pay-TV and broadband providers proposed a final dividend of 4.75 cents per share, taking its total dividend to 7.00 cents, up 27.5% from 5.49 cents in 2013. Pace posted a pretax profit of USD175.7 million, up from USD130.8 million, as a rise in revenue to USD2.62 billion from USD2.47 billion offset an increase in cost of sales and a rise in administrative expenses to USD351.6 million from USD309.4 million.\n----------\nMarine services company James Fisher & Sons reported a rise in pretax profit and revenue in 2014 and increased its dividend by 10% on the back of a solid performance across its business, and said it has struck a deal to buy a South African marine services company. The FTSE 250-listed company said its pretax profit ticked up to GBP49.2 million, from GBP46.2 million in 2013, as revenue rose to GBP444.8 million from GBP413.7 million.\n----------\nManufacturing company Rotork said its pretax profit rose in 2014 as revenue was buoyed by strong sales in the power market, and it said that growth in other sectors would help offset the challenging energy markets it is expecting in the current year. The FTSE 250-listed company, which makes actuators and flow control products, said its pretax profit for the year was GBP141.2 million, up from GBP138 million in 2013, as revenue rose to GBP594.7 million from GBP578.4 million on the back of a 16% increase in sales to the power market.\n----------\nJardine Lloyd Thompson Group reported higher profits and revenue for 2014 as it managed to combat a market decline in both insurance and re-insurance rates, and it said it was confident in its revenue growth momentum going forward. The insurance, re-insurance and employee benefits adviser and broker reported a pretax profit of GBP159.7 million for 2014, up from GBP154.6 million in 2013, as revenue rose to GBP1.10 billion, from GBP979.2 million, but its operating margin slipped to 17.8% from 18.9%.\n----------\nTullett Prebon reported lower profit and revenue for 2014 as market conditions for interdealer brokers remained challenging amid subdued trading activity, and it said revenue in the first two months of 2015 is flat excluding its recent acquisition of PVM. Tullett reported a pretax profit of GBP33.5 million for 2014, down from GBP84.4 million in 2013, while the figure excluding exceptional and acquisition-related items fell to GBP86.6 million from GBP99.6 million as revenue declined to GBP703.5 million from GBP803.7 million. Despite the profit fall, Tullett said it will pay an unchanged total dividend of 16.85p.\n----------\nVesuvius reported a rise in pretax profit in 2014 despite lower revenue as the group improved its profit margins and brought down costs. The molten flow engineering company said its pretax profit for 2014 was GBP111.2 million, compared to GBP104.1 million last year. Revenue fell to GBP1.44 billion from GBP1.51 billion last year, but the group brought down its manufacturing and administrative costs in the year to improve profitability. The group will pay a total dividend for the year of 16.125 pence, compared to 15 pence last year.\n----------\nTransport company Stagecoach Group reported like-for-like revenue growth across its operations as the company said it remains on track to meet its expectations for the year. Stagecoach said its overall profitability in the first 40 weeks of its financial year, ending April 30, was \"satisfactory\", and it remains on track to meet its expectations for its full-year results.\n----------\nLaird said it has good momentum for further growth in 2015, as it posted a rise in pretax profit for 2014 and upped its total dividend. The company proposed a final dividend of 8.23 pence, taking its total dividend for 2014 up to 12.5 pence from 12.0 pence in 2013. Laird posted a pretax profit of GBP48.1 million, up from GBP43.2 million, as revenue rose 5% to GBP564.9 million from GBP537.0 million. On a dollar basis, revenue was up 11%. The company makes around 70% of its revenue in dollars.\n----------\nMARKETS\n----------\nUK shares are trading flat to firm in a busy day of corporate reporting, while UK construction activity showed its sharpest expansion in four months.\n----------\nFTSE 100: up 0.2% at 6,952.61\nFTSE 250: up 0.1% at 17,262.21\nAIM ALL-SHARE: up 0.1% at 713.54\n----------\n",

The payment will reduce the bank’s tangible net asset value per share by about 10 pence in the first quarter and would have lowered its common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of financial strength, by about 50 basis points at the end of 2015. \nChief Executive Officer Ross McEwan, 58, is checking off another item from an extensive list of issues he must overcome to help Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne return the bank to full private ownership and pay a dividend. McEwan has pledged to return capital to shareholders next year once the bank has reached a deal with U.S. authorities over the sale of mortgage-backed securities, passed stress tests from the Bank of England and agreed to sell its Williams & Glyn consumer bank.\n“This is another important milestone in our plan to resume capital distributions to our shareholders,” McEwan said in the statement. “On the back of progress we have made in strengthening the bank’s balance sheet in recent years, I am pleased that we are today able to repay the U.K. government 1.2 billion pounds to finally retire the dividend access share.”\nThe DAS was issued in 2009 when the U.K. Treasury provided 25.5 billion pounds of equity capital to RBS to help save it from collapse and gave the state enhanced dividend rights for the support it provided. RBS had already paid 320 million pounds toward canceling the DAS in 2014.\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal. LEARN MORE\n",

Morrison Supermarket (LON:MRW) has continued its boardroom cull with the departure of group trading director Casper Meijer. Britainâ€™s fourth-largest grocer announced late yesterday that Meijer was leaving with immediate effect after the Dutchman refused to base himself permanently in the UK.\nMeijer was poached from Albert Heijn, one of the biggest supermarket chains in the Netherlands, to become trading director of Morrisons in December 2012. While he was living in the UK during the week, Meijer is thought to have been leaving on Friday afternoons to fly back to Amsterdam where his family is based.\nâ€œCasper has played an important role in starting the process of making Morrisons better value for money for customers,â€� Morrisonsâ€™ chief executive, David Potts, said in a statement. â€œHowever, we both believe now is the right time for this crucial role to be taken by an executive who will dedicate all their efforts to living and working here in Britain,â€� he added.\nMorrisons further revealed that the search for a successor of Meijer would start immediately and Andrew Pleasance, who had worked closely with the groupâ€™s supply base, would take on the role of group trading director on an interim basis.\nThis latest change means that six of Morrisonsâ€™ nine-strong senior management board, excluding the chief executive and the finance chief, have been cut since Potts took the reins of the struggling chain a month ago. The CEO is looking to build a new leadership team to try and reverse years of profit decline and market share losses.\nMorrisonsâ€™ share price closed yesterdayâ€™s trading session 0.99 percent at 200.20p. In the year to date, the stock has advanced just over 10 percent.\n",

Reuters also reported that Saudi Arabi’s oil minister Ali al-Naimi had reassured that ‘markets are calm now … demand is growing’.\nThis wasn’t enough to save Weir ( WEIR ), the FTSE’s biggest faller. Shares in the valve maker slid 8.6% or £1.62 to £17.04 after the company predicted the downturn in the oil and gas industry would hit revenues this year despite its efforts to cut costs.\n‘We are assuming this will be a longer-lasting downturn than those that we experienced in 2012-13 and 2009,’ chief executive Keith Cochrane told reporters on a conference call after Weir reported a 2% fall in profits last year.\nBy contrast, Petrofac ( PFC ) proved the impact of lower oil prices can be unpredictable as shares in the FTSE 250 stock jumped 10% or 81p to 898p after the oil services company revealed its order backlog had risen 26% at the end of last year. ‘A lot of our work is in the Middle East and North Africa mainly for national oil companies and they are continuing to invest through the downcycle, Tim Weller, chief financial officer, told Reuters.\nInvestors in AO World ( AO ), the online retailer of fridges and cookers that has been listed on the stock market for under a year, didn’t take kindly to warning that full-year revenues would be 2% lower than expected while core earnings would be around £16.5 million, down from an earlier forecast of £18.6 million.\nThe shares slumped 28% or 81p to 200p, leading the FTSE 250 37 points lower at 17,165.\nThere was  better news from St James’s Place ( SJP ). The upmarket financial salesforce was the fastest rising blue chip, up more than 5% or 44.5p to 936.5p, after it hiked its final dividend by 50% to 14.37p per share. Chief executive David Bellamy pleased investors by saying he would raise the proportion of free cash flow paid to shareholders to 75% from 70% in the next few years. This followed a 24% rise in full-year profits to £173.8 million.\nWhitbread ( WTB ) was also in favour, up 2.5% or £1.25 to £52.30, after revealing good fourth quarter trading at its Premier Inn hotels and Costa Coffee shops would push full-year profits to the top of analysts’ forecasts.\nElsewhere, Morrisons ( MRW ) gained 0.9% or 1.7p to 193.5p after the supermarket named David Potts, a former Tesco executive, as its new boss. Potts joins former colleagues Andrew Higginson, now chairman, and Trevor Strain, new finance chief, at the supermarket. All left Tesco ( TSCO ) long before its accounting scandal broke last year.\nInternational Personal Finance ( IPF ), the sister company of door-to-door lender Provident Financial ( PFG ), was under the cosh after warning that competition from payday lenders in Poland and the Czech Republic had slowed its growth in eastern Europe. The shares tumbled 8.3% or 39p to 428.5p.\n \nEmail me when someone comments on this article Print\nleave a comment\nPlease sign in here or register here to comment.

Lloyds is relatively insulated because of its greater reliance on retail customers.\n\"Overall, these represent a solid if unexciting set of results, which is not necessarily a bad thing for a bank,\" said Gary Greenwood, an analyst at Shore Capital.\nLloyds shares fell 2.9 percent to 67.2 pence by 1130 GMT, as some analysts questioned whether the bank would be able to boost revenue against the backdrop of a slowing British economy.\n\"The bank insurance contribution and retail fee income was notably soft,\" said Ian Gordon, an analyst at Investec.\nFinance Minister George Osborne is looking to sell the last remaining government-held shares in Lloyds over the next year after a discounted sale to the general public was postponed earlier this year due to turmoil in global financial markets.\nBanking and political sources expect the sale of Lloyds' shares to resume after the British referendum on membership of the European Union in June, concluding with a larger offer to retail investors.\nThe state has reduced its holding from 43 percent to less than 10 percent, raising over 16 billion pounds.\nPROVISIONS\nBritain's largest retail bank said total income fell 1 percent to 4.4 billion pounds, as higher revenue from its retail bank were offset by lower income in its insurance division.\nImpairments dropped 6 percent to 149 million pounds.\n\"These results demonstrate the strength of our differentiated, simple, low risk business model and reflect our ability to actively respond to the challenging operating environment,\" Horta-Osório said in the statement.\nLloyds did not provision any money to repay customers mis-sold loan insurance this quarter, an indication that a scandal that has plagued the bank and sharply reduced profits over recent years is starting to recede.\nThe bank has been forced to set aside about 16 billion pounds since the financial crisis to repay customers who took out policies to protect borrowers against sickness or redundancy, but were often ineligible to claim.

It wrote down aluminium assets and coal mining in Mozambique by $14 billion.\nA basket of other commodities, from uranium and salt to aluminium and titanium, contribute little if anything to the bottom line.\nRio Tinto is targeting $5 billion in cost cuts by the end of 2014, two-thirds of that from its energy units, which include coal and uranium, and from aluminium. Each has been hit by low prices and soaring costs, particularly in Australia.\nIn Coal and Allied, Rio Tinto is seeking to sell up to 29 percent of its stake, the WSJ reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter.\n\"There's been some speculation that they will try and exit thermal coal, it just doesn't make sense for them. They make all their money out of iron ore and thermal coal just doesn't fit the model,\" said a coal industry executive who asked not to be named.\n\"The problem is, in this climate, who's the buyer,\" he said.\nRio Tinto has made no secret of its desire to down size its aluminium division after buying Alcan in 2007 for $38 billion.\nIts Pacific Aluminium unit was established to bundle 13 underperforming aluminium assets for closure, sale or spin off into a separate entity for an in-specie distribution to Rio Tinto shareholders.\n\"If Rio could divest everything except for its iron ore operations in Australia and Canada, and its flagship copper assets at Escondida and Kennecott, it would generate a higher profit, and at a substantially higher return,\" Commonwealth Bank of Australia said in a research report.\nRio Tinto owns 80 percent of Coal & Allied, and wants to cut its holding to as low as 51 percent, according to the WSJ.\nThe miner is also seeking a buyer for its controlling stakes in the Clermont and neighbouring Blair Athol mines in Queensland state for more than $1 billion, the WSJ said in a separate report. The Blair Athol mine was closed by Rio Tinto in November.\nRio Tinto and Deutsche Bank declined to comment on the reports.\nRio Tinto and Japan's Mitsubishi Corp bought Coal & Allied Industries in late 2011 in a deal valuing it at A$10.6 billion.\nClermont holds 177 million tonnes of thermal coal, with a maximum capacity of up to 12.2 million tonnes a year, and has an expected life of 17 years, according to Rio Tinto.\nAustralian benchmark thermal coal prices are currently hovering below $90 a tonne, down from an all-time high of above $174/tonne in 2008 and near the cost of production for many Australian coal mines.\nNext In Basic Materials\n",

Sign up to follow, and we’ll e-mail you free updates as they’re published.\nYou’ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published.\nYou’re all set!\nOIL\nRuling lowers possible BP fine\nBP will face a maximum fine of $13.7 billion under the Clean Water Act for its Gulf of Mexico oil spill, several billion less than expected, after a judge found on Thursday that the size of the spill was smaller than the U.S. government claimed.\nThe ruling by federal magistrate Carl Barbier put the size of the worst offshore spill in U.S. history in 2010 at 3.19 million barrels. That was less than the government’s estimate of 4.09 million barrels, which could have led to penalties of up to $17.6 billion.\nUnder a “gross negligence” ruling that Barbier issued in September, BP could be fined a statutory limit of up to $4,300 for each barrel spilled, although he has authority to assign lower penalties. A simple “negligence” ruling, which BP sought, caps the maximum fine at $1,100 per barrel.\nOn Thursday, Barbier said BP’s response to the disaster was not grossly negligent, but stuck to his earlier opinion that it was grossly negligent leading up to the Macondo well blowout.\nPenalties will be assigned after the third and final phase of the company’s non-jury trial, which starts Tuesday in New Orleans. The Clean Water Act penalties would come on top of more than $42 billion the oil major has set aside or spent for clean-up, compensation and fines.\n— Reuters\nBig banks end year with weak numbers\nThe final months of 2014 were more difficult for big banks than investors suspected.\nBank of America and Citigroup reported disappointing results Thursday, hit by lower trading revenues and more legal expenses. That followed JPMorgan Chase’s weaker earnings announced the day before. Shares of all three banks on Thursday fell more than 3 percent.\nLike JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America saw drops in their fixed-income trading revenue as client trading activity slowed. Citi said revenue in that part of its business fell to $2 billion in the period, a drop of 16 percent from a year earlier. BofA’s fixed-income trading revenue fell to $1.5 billion from $1.9 billion a year earlier.\nLegal costs have also weighed on the banks. Citigroup warned investors that it would incur charges of $3.5 billion for the fourth quarter to cover the costs of investigations into currency trading, the manipulation of a key interest rate and anti-money laundering probes. JPMorgan disclosed $990 million in after-tax legal expenses related to its own foreign currency probes.\nFor the fourth quarter, Bank of America announced profit of $3.05 billion, down from $3.44 billion a year earlier. Total revenue at Bank of America fell 12.6 percent to $18.96 billion. Citigroup had a quarterly profit of $350 million compared with $2.5 billion a year earlier. Revenue was flat at $17.78 billion.\n— Associated Press\nAlso in Business\n● The end of the holiday shopping season led to more Americans seeking unemployment benefits last week, raising the number of applications to an 18-week high. The Labor Department said applications for benefits jumped 19,000 to a seasonally adjusted 316,000. The four-week average, a less volatile measure, rose 6,750 to 298,000. That average has plunged 11.4 percent over the past 12 months and has remained near historically low 300,000 levels since September.\n● Chipmaker Intel forecast current quarter revenue and gross margins that disappointed investors. Revenue from its mainstay PC business fell about 3 percent to $8.9 billion in the fourth quarter from the third, raising doubts about the recovery of the personal computer business. The chipmaker forecast first-quarter revenue of $13.76 billion, plus or minus $500 million, and gross margins of about 60 percent, far below the 65.4 percent it reported in the fourth quarter.\n● Google is winding down its program allowing anyone to buy its smart Glass headset as it puzzles out the future of the gadget.

The stock was purchased by institutional investors in an offering organized by Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\nSports Direct shares fell as much as 6 percent to 715 pence, the biggest intraday decline since April 8. They were down 5.8 percent at 716.5 pence as of 2:26 p.m.\nAshley, who founded Sports Direct in 1982 and owns Premier League soccer club Newcastle United, has an estimated wealth of $5.6 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\nThe sale may add further fuel to speculation in the U.K. media that Ashley is considering lending money to soccer club Glasgow Rangers. Statements from Sports Direct and Goldman Sachs offered no reason for the divestment.\nSports Direct is scheduled to report third-quarter sales on Feb. 19. The sporting-goods retailer said Dec. 11 that it remained confident of at least achieving its full-year target for underlying earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of 360 million pounds.\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

REUTERS/Toby Melville\n1/3\nleft\nright\nBen van Beurden (L), chief executive officer of Royal Dutch Shell, shakes hand with Andrew Gould, chairman of the BG Group, during a news conference at the London Stock Exchange, April 8, 2015. REUTERS/Stefan Wermuth\n2/3\nleft\nright\nShell's company logo is pictured at a gas station in Zurich April 8, 2015. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann\n3/3\nBy Dmitry Zhdannikov and Karolin Schaps | LONDON\nLONDON Royal Dutch Shell agreed to buy smaller rival BG Group for 47 billion pounds ($70 billion) in the first major energy industry merger in more than a decade, closing the gap on market leader U.S. Exxon Mobil after a plunge in prices.\nAnglo-Dutch Shell will pay a mix of cash and shares that  values each BG share at around 1,350 pence, the companies said. This is a hefty premium of around 52 percent to the 90-day trading average for BG, setting the bar high for any potential counter-bid by a company such as Exxon, which has said it would also use the downturn in oil markets to expand.\nThe third-biggest oil and gas deal ever by enterprise value will bring Shell assets in Brazil, East Africa, Australia, Kazakhstan and Egypt. BG has some of the world's most ambitious projects in liquefied natural gas (LNG), where demand is growing as consumers turn away from more polluting fuels such as coal.\nShell is already the world's leading LNG company and it would get BG's capacity in LNG logistics - complex infrastructure that includes terminals, pipelines, specialised tankers, rigs, super coolers, regasification facilities and storage points.\n\"We are seeing a gasification of energy demand. Shell clearly recognise this,\" said Richard Gorry, director at JBC Energy Asia. \"That said, Shell is still taking a big gamble because if the price of oil and gas doesn't go back up (in the next 24 months), I would imagine this might put them in a difficult position in terms of cash flow.\"\nBOOST TO RESERVES\nShell said on Wednesday the deal would boost its proven oil and gas reserves by 25 percent.\nStitched together by Shell CEO Ben van Beurden and BG Chairman Andrew Gould, the tie-up follows a halving of oil prices since last June, putting a premium on access to proven assets rather than costly exploration. Record low interest rates have made it easy to raise cheap funding for big deals.\n\"We have been scanning quite a few opportunities, with BG always being at the top of the list of the prospects to combine with,\" Van Beurden told a conference call. \"We have two very strong portfolios combining globally in deep water and integrated gas\".\nBritain's BG had a market capitalisation of $46 billion at Tuesday's close, Shell was worth $202 billion and Exxon, the world's largest energy company by market value, was worth $360 billion.\nBG's bonds traded up strongly on the deal and its shares closed up 27 percent at 1206 pence. Shell shares fell 5 percent to 1982.5 pence. They were the most traded stocks across Europe on Wednesday, with $1.6 billion of BG shares changing hands and $3 billion of Royal Dutch Shell shares.\nBG stock has tumbled nearly 28 percent since mid-June, when the slump in global oil prices began. The agreed price is around 20 percent above BG's share price of a year ago.\n\"In buying BG, Shell is making a bold strategic bet that oil prices will recover towards the $70-90 level in the medium term,\" said Henderson Global Investors. Brent crude was trading below $57 a barrel on Wednesday.\nBarclays bank said Shell would have to persuade its shareholders that it can control capital spending at the new company and show BG's portfolio can deliver the promised growth options beyond Brazil, \"something that, in our view, has been far from evident of late\".\nOne source close to the deal said a counterbid was unlikely. The source said a U.S. company such as Exxon may be doubly wary of getting into a takeover battle after the failure of drugmaker Pfizer's attempted takeover of AstraZeneca last year.\nThe deal represents a windfall for Shell's adviser Bank of America Merrill Lynch. BG's advisers are Goldman Sachs and the smaller Robey Warshaw.\nBAML has underwritten a 3.025-billion-pound bridge loan that will be syndicated to other banks and is expected to be taken out by a capital markets raising, according to the offer documents.\nOIL PRICE IMPACT\nWith BG, Shell would be the leading foreign oil company in Brazil. Analysts at investment bank Jefferies said they now expected Shell to surpass Exxon as the world's largest publicly traded oil and gas producer by 2018, with output of 4.2 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.\nGlobal LNG production was 246 million tonnes last year. The new Shell-BG group would have 18 percent of world output.\nVan Beurden said the presence of two large players in Australia, Brazil and China and the European Union might require a detailed conversation with anti-trust authorities, but was unlikely to lead to forced asset sales.\nThe halving in crude prices has created an environment similar to the turn of the millennium, when large mergers reshaped the industry. Back then, BP acquired rivals Amoco and Arco, Exxon bought Mobil and Chevron merged with Texaco.\n\"A deal of this size would certainly be getting everyone interested in running the ruler over potential combinations in the natural resources sector,\" said Paul Gait, an analyst at Bernstein Research.\nBut some industry watchers were reluctant to predict another flurry of mega-deals, saying many oil majors cannot afford to put stretched balance sheets under further pressure.\n\"If you're looking to the next big deal, Exxon Mobil stands out as most likely to pull the trigger,\" said Wood Mackenzie. \"But don't expect a wave of late '90s-style consolidation.\"\nShell has long been seen as a potential buyer thanks to its healthy cash flow and relatively low oil price breakeven.\nThe deal, which should generate pretax synergies of around 2.5 billion pounds per year, will result in BG shareholders owning around 19 percent of the combined group.\nLast year, BG Chairman Gould hired CEO Helge Lund from Norway's Statoil to turn around the company. Gould said on Wednesday Lund would remain the CEO through the transition.\nHowever, it was evident the deal was driven by Van Beurden, who took over as the CEO last year, and Gould, a veteran executive who previously ran oil services giant Schlumberger.\n\"I called Andrew up and we had a very good and constructive discussion about the idea and it very quickly seemed to make sense to both of us,\" Van Beurden told a conference call. \"What has happened in the last month, apart from it being a logical deal, it has also become a very compelling deal from a value perspective,\"\n(This version of the story has been refiled to fix name of Exxon Mobil)\n(Reporting by Narottam Medhora and Sai Sachin R in Bengaluru; additional reporting by Greg Roumeliotis and Denny Thomas, Henning Gloystein, Karolin Schaps, Kate Holton, Chris Mangham, Freya Berry, Silvia Antonioli and Vikram Subhedar; writing by Denny Thomas and Tom Pfeiffer; editing by Keith Weir and David Stamp)\nNext In Global Energy News\nShell CEO expects no valuation hit from climate accord\nAMSTERDAM Royal Dutch Shell  expects to pump out all the fossil fuel reserves listed on its balance sheet, its chief executive said, dismissing concerns that production limits in the wake of the Paris climate accord could hit the energy giant's valuation.\n",

  "articleText" : "Diageo receives reports from United Spirits on financial irregularities involving Vijay Mallya\nBy ET Bureau | Updated: Apr 28, 2015, 07.05 AM IST\nDiageo said that it has received three different reports from USL which talk about various alleged irregular financial transactions involving Mallya.\nRELATED COMPANIES\nChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz\nClose ✕\nMUMBAI: British drinks major Diageo — also the principal shareholder of United Spirits (USL) — said on Monday that it has received three different reports from USL which talk about various alleged irregular financial transactions involving the company's non-executive chairman Vijay Mallya , UB Group entities and various other corporate as well as individual entities.\n\"Subsequent to its announcement on April 25, 2015, USL has provided its inquiry report and all related materials to Diageo. Diageo notes the recommendation of the USL board and will now consider its position under its agreements with Mallya and United Breweries Holdings (UBHL) in the light of the inquiry report and materials provided to it,\" Diageo said in a statement from London.\nET, in its Monday edition, had reported USL's intention to present these reports to parent Diageo, requesting it to review its contractual obligations with USL and oust him from his post. It is also expected to approach the Securities and Exchange Board of India with the same set of reports. It remains unclear if it has already done so.\nA detailed questionnaire sent to a USL spokesperson in India did not elicit any response till the time of going to press late on Monday.\nLast week, a PwC forensic audit into the company's books had found \"impropriety and violations\", regarding transactions of close to Rs 2,000 crore.Following the audit, the board of USL — citing loss of confidence — asked Mallya to step down.\nMallya has refused to do so and has said Diageo is contractually bound to support and vote along with him. Diageo, which holds a 54.8% stake in USL, said in its statement that it indeed has \"certain contractual obligations to support Mallya's continuance as non-executive director and chairman of USL, subject to certain conditions and in the absence of certain defaults.\"\nMaking public for the first time the contents of its Shareholders Agreement with Mallya, Diageo said: \"Under the agreement, the parties agreed to use their respective rights as shareholders such that, among other things, UBHL would be able to nominate one director (who would be Mallya) to the USL board. This right of UBHL is subject to it continuing to hold at least 1,307,950 shares in USL and Mallya continuing to control UBHL. In certain circumstances where Mallya ceases to control UBHL, Mallya may become entitled to succeed to the right to nominate himself as a director of USL subject to his holding at least 1,307,950 USL shares.\"\nIt goes on to say, \"Previously, UBHL also had the right to recommend a second, independent, non-executive director as long as it continued to hold at least 6,539,750 shares in USL. Following an earlier reduction in the UBHL group's shareholding in USL, this recommendation right has fallen away.\"\nTo give effect to these rights, Diageo is obliged, under the Shareholders Agreement and a separate agreement with Mallya, \"to support his continuance as non-executive director and chairman of USL. These obligations of Diageo are subject to the conditions described above and the absence of certain defaults by UBHL and Mallya\".\n\"Only shareholders can remove Vijay Mallya from the board of USL. For Mallya, to continue as chairman, it is essential that he remains a director on the board,\" said Ravi Singhania, managing partner of Rajani, Singhania & Partners. \"As per the Companies Act, in my view, the Board can appoint a new chairman without going back to the shareholders unless the Articles of Association provide, otherwise,\" Singhania added.\nHowever, in a contrarian stand, Sanjay Asher, Senior Partner of law firm Crawford Bayley said, \"There has to be good reason why the board is amending the existing clause and superseding the current chairman and director. Though the majority shares are owned by Diageo, the company will have to pass an ordinary resolution after calling for an emergency shareholder meeting if they want to remove Mallya,\" he said.\nStay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!\nDON'T MISSany stories, follow us on Twitter Follow\nFROM AROUND THE WEB\n",

  "articleURL" : "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-06/chipotle-says-sales-dropped-even-more-than-expected-last-quarter",
  "articleText" : "Chipotle Adds Grand Jury Subpoena to Food Safety Woes\nSales dropped as much as 37% in wake of foodborne illnesses\nMultiple outbreaks across country batter chain's reputation\nShare on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp\nChipotle Mexican Grill Inc., struggling to rebound from multiple outbreaks of foodborne illness, reported a bigger plunge in fourth-quarter sales than the restaurant chain expected and said it got served with a subpoena in a federal criminal investigation.\nSame-store sales -- a closely watched benchmark -- tumbled 14.6 percent in the period, the Denver-based company said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday. The decline, Chipotle’s first quarterly drop as a public company, was previously projected to be as much as 11 percent. The grand jury subpoena, meanwhile, stemmed from a probe into a norovirus outbreak by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the central district of California, which is working with the Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations.\nChipotle’s reputation has been hammered in recent months by an outbreak of E. coli that afflicted at least 53 people in nine states. That was followed by a norovirus contagion at a Boston location that sickened more than 140 college students. A new spate of illnesses in three additional states was announced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention late last month.\nThe shares fell 5 percent to close at $426.67 in New York , reaching their lowest point in more than two years. The stock declined 30 percent in 2015.\nIn the wake of the Boston outbreak -- and the national news coverage that followed -- same-store sales fell 34 percent, the company said on Wednesday. After the CDC report on the additional E. coli cases in late December, the sales dropped 37 percent. They were down 30 percent for the full month of December, Chipotle said.\nEarnings Estimate\nThe company now estimates that fourth-quarter earnings will range from $1.70 to $1.90 a share. Analysts predicted $2.49 before the announcement, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Chipotle also expects to record $14 million to $16 million in expenses during the quarter because of the crisis. The company has had to replace food in restaurants, conduct lab tests and boost marketing to cope with the situation.\nChipotle also is making more share buybacks as it tries to placate investors. The board agreed to repurchase $300 million in stock, in addition to $300 million announced on Dec. 4.\nCalifornia Case\nThe subpoena pertains to a norovirus case at a Chipotle in Simi Valley, California, in August. That outbreak sickened at least 234 customers and employees, though it didn’t generate much national publicity before the E. coli incidents. \nThe illnesses in California were caused by a employee who had the highly contagious virus but wasn’t sent home from work. Steve Ells, Chipotle’s co-chief executive officer, recently told Bloomberg News that the norovirus outbreaks in California and Boston involved breaches of protocol that were established in 2008 after the virus sickened 500 people near Kent State University in Ohio. Norovirus is the leading cause of illness from contaminated foods, affecting as many as 21 million people in the U.S. every year. Its symptoms, including diarrhea, vomiting and stomach pain, usually last a couple of days.\nChris Arnold, a spokesman for Chipotle, declined to comment on the investigation, as did the U.S. attorney’s office that issued the subpoena. The FDA said it couldn’t provide more details on the investigation.\n“When foodborne illness outbreaks occur, the FDA works closely with other federal and state agencies and other health officials to identify the source, ensure the companies are removing affected foods from the marketplace, and communicate with the public,” the agency said in a statement. “No system is foolproof, but the FDA works to prevent as many foodborne illness outbreaks as possible.”\n‘Range of Documents’\nIn the filing, Chipotle said it’s been asked to produce a “broad range of documents” as part of the subpoena in California. “It is not possible at this time to determine whether we will incur, or to reasonably estimate the amount of, any fines, penalties or further liabilities in connection with the investigation pursuant to which the subpoena was issued,” the company said.\nThe grand jury probe isn’t the first legal tangle for Chipotle. It’s already involved in\na U.S. government immigration investigation that started in 2010 and caused the company to fire hundreds of workers. In 2012, prosecutors began probing possible criminal securities-law violations and subpoenaed the company regarding work authorizations.\nIn the latest probe, it’s difficult to determine what potential crime is being investigated, according to Bill Marler, a Seattle lawyer who has worked on food-safety cases for more than 20 years and is representing about a dozen customers who got sick after eating at the Simi Valley restaurant. He also was unsure why federal authorities have jurisdiction over a case that appears to involve a single restaurant in California. There have only been a handful of criminal investigations into these kinds of food-safety problems, and they typically involve products shipped across state lines, he said.\n“I don’t see what the federal jurisdiction is,” he said. “It’s not like they were shipping burritos to Reno.”\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

  "articleText" : "Apr 08, 2015 06:46 AM EDT\nShell offers 50 percent premium to buy BG for $70 billion\nTAG: Shell , Royal Dutch Shell , BG Group , Oil , Oil Industry , Market , Oil Price\nRoyal Dutch Shell  ( RDSa.L ) agreed to buy smaller rival BG Group ( BG.L ) for $70 billion in the first major oil industry merger in more than a decade, closing the gap on market leader U.S. ExxonMobil ( XOM.N ) after a plunge in prices.\nAdvertisement\nAnglo-Dutch Shell will pay a mix of cash and shares that values each BG share at around 1,350 pence ($20), the energy companies said on Wednesday. This is a hefty premium of around 52 percent to the 90-day trading average for BG, setting the bar high for any potential rival bidders.\nThe biggest merger this year will give Shell access to BG's multi-billion-dollar operations inBrazil, East Africa, Australia, Kazakhstan and Egypt. These include some of the world's most ambitious liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects.\nAdvertisement\nStitched together by Shell CEO Ben van Beurden and BG Chairman Andrew Gould, the deal comes after oil prices halved since last June, putting a premium on access to proven assets rather than costly exploration.\n\"We have been scanning quite a few opportunities, with BG always being at the top of the list of the prospects to combine with,\" Shell's Van Beurden told a conference call.\n\"We have two very strong portfolios combining globally in deep water and integrated gas\".\nShell said the deal would boost its proven oil and gas reserves by 25 percent. The firm also plans to increase asset sales to $30 billion between 2016-2018 on the back of the deal.\nBritain's BG had a market capitalization of $46 billion as of Tuesday close, Shell was worth $202 billion while Exxon, the world's largest oil company by market value, was worth $360 billion.\nBG shares leapt 37 percent for 1,250 pence, while Shell's were down 2.2 percent at 2048 pence by 0905 GMT. BG shares have tumbled nearly 28 percent since mid-June, when the slump in global oil prices started.\n \nCOMPETITION ISSUES\nVan Beurden said the presence of two large firms in Australia,  Brazil  and China and the European Union might require a detailed conversation with anti-trust authorities but was unlikely to lead to forced asset sales.\nThe halving in crude prices on the back of a shale oil boom in the United States and a decision by Saudi Arabia not to cut production has created an environment similar to the turn of the century when many large mergers took place.\nBack then, oil major BP ( BP.L ) acquired rival Amoco and Arco, Exxon bought Mobil and Chevron ( CVX.N ) merged with Texaco.\nShell has long been seen as a potential purchaser thanks to its healthy cash flow and relatively low oil price breakeven.\nThe company was able to maintain capital and operating expenses and pay dividend at a price of oil of around $75 per barrel without borrowing too much money. However, BG's breakeven is as high as $145 per barrel, according to analyst estimates.\nLast year, BG Chairman Gould hired CEO Helge Lund from Norway's Statoil ( STL.OL ) to turn around the company. Gould said on Wednesday Lund would remain the CEO through transition.\nHowever, it became evident on Wednesday the deal was done by two people -- Van Beurden, who took over as the CEO last year - and Gould, a veteran executive who previously run oil services giant Schlumberger ( SLB.N ).\n\"I called Andrew up and we had a very good and constructive discussion about the idea and it very quickly seemed to make sense to both of us,\" Van Beurden told a conference call.\n\"What has happened in last month, apart from it being a logical deal it has also become a very compelling deal from a value perspective,\" he added.\nThe deal, which should generate pretax synergies of around 2.5 billion pounds per year, will result in BG shareholders owning around 19 percent of the combined group.\n\"We fully understand the strategic drivers of the transaction, and believe the fit an excellent one for Shell,\" analysts from Jefferies said.\n\"The imperative now becomes for management to convince the market of the financial implications: near term earnings dilution; a significantly more levered balance sheet; and a higher priority for debt reduction versus dividends on cash utilization,\" they added.\nShell is being advised by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, while BG's advisers are Goldman Sachs and Robey Warshaw.\nAdvertisement\n",

  "articleText" : "Morrisons share price: Founderâ€™s son to assist CEO with turnaround\nDavid Potts seeks advice from Ken Morrison\nby Jane Tindall Friday, 15 May 2015, 14:48 BST\nThe newly-appointed chief executive of Wm. Morrison Supermarkets (LON:MRW), David Potts, has sought the counsel of Ken Morrison, the son of the chainâ€™s founder and a former head of the business, Reuters today revealed.\nAccording to the report, Morrison â€“ who ran the UKâ€™s fourth-largest grocer for more than 50 years before stepping down in 2008 â€“ has so far toured about 10 Morrisons stores with Potts. The octogenarian, whose family still owns about 10 percent of the groupâ€™s equity, told Reuters today: \"Itâ€™s simply just going round some stores ... comparing notes and hopefully helping a little to bed him (Potts) into the business.\" He added: \"If I can help at all, Iâ€™m more than delighted to.\"\nMorrison was a fierce critic of former CEO Dalton Philips, standing up at last year's annual general meeting to lambaste his strategy as â€˜bullshitâ€™ . The retail veteran has welcomed this yearâ€™s leadership change, noting that Potts has made a good start to the job. Particularly, Morrison has praised the new bossâ€™ decisions to add 5,000 shop floor workers to improve customer service and bring back staffed express checkouts.\nLast week, when Morrisons reported another fall in quarterly sales , Potts said he would present his strategic plans for the business in September. At the time of the Q1 trading results announcement, Potts hinted that he was in a position to call on the wisdom of Ken Morrison but did not give any further details.\nMorrisonsâ€™ shares have been trading in positive territory so far today. As of 14:12 GMT, the stock was changing hands at 180.47p â€“ 0.71 percent up intraday. The FTSE 100-listed retailer lost around 12 percent of its market value in the past year.\n",

  "articleText" : "Tesco share price jumps as Q3 sales top estimates\nRetailer announces raft of measures to put company back on track\nby Deyana Ivanova Thursday, 08 Jan 2015, 09:01 GMT\niNVEZZ.com, Thursday, January 8: Tescoâ€™s (LON:TSCO) share price opened around five percent higher this morning, after the UKâ€™s largest retailer delivered a better-than-expected performance in the third quarter and unveiled a raft of measures to help the group reign in costs and rebuild its damaged reputation after a turbulent year.\nIn a trading update covering the 19 weeks to 3 January 2015, Tesco revealed a 2.9 percent decline in like-for-like sales for its UK business -- better than analystsâ€™ predictions of a three to four percent fall and a significant improvement on the 5.4 percent slump recorded in the second quarter ( Tesco share price opens lower amid drastic overhaul plan ). Sales over the six-week Christmas period fell 0.3 percent. Tesco reaffirmed its guidance to deliver a trading profit of â€˜no more than Â£1.4 billionâ€™ for the financial year ending 27 February 2015, compared to Â£3.3 billion the year before.\nSeeking to recover from four profit warnings and an accounting scandal last year, Tescoâ€™s chief executive, Dave Lewis, unveiled his overhaul plan alongside the trading update. With the company's pension deficit and debt levels growing, Tesco said it would reduce its capital expenditure for next year to Â£1 billion from up to Â£2.1 billion this year and cut costs by Â£250 million a year. It will also not pay a final dividend and will consult on a plan to close its defined benefit pension scheme to all members.\nThe new measures include a decision to sell the companyâ€™s Blinkbox movie streaming service to TalkTalk PLC for an undisclosed sum. Tesco said that it was also exploring â€˜strategic optionsâ€™ for its Dunnhumby data business. Among other changes, 43 unprofitable stores will close, while the head office will be relocated to Welwyn Garden City, England. The grocer further announced the appointment of Matt Davies, CEO of car parts retailer Halfords Group Plc, as the new boss of its UK and Ireland business.\nAccording to Tescoâ€™s statement, the steps announced today were just the first in a drive to strengthen the balance sheet and further initiatives to increase shareholder value were under consideration. Lewis stated: \"I am very conscious that the consequences of these changes are significant for all stakeholders in our business but we are facing the reality of the situation. There is more to do but we have taken the first important steps in the right direction.\"\nTescoâ€™s trading update comes a day after Sainsburyâ€™s announced a 1.7 percent fall in like-for-like sales over the key festive period ( Sainsburyâ€™s share price jumps as Q3 sales fall less than expected ). Although marking the retailerâ€™s worst Christmas in more than a decade, the decline was smaller than analysts had expected.\nInvestorsâ€™ have reacted positively to todayâ€™s update, sending Tescoâ€™s share price more than five percent higher in early trading. As of 08:32 GMT, the stock was changing hands at 190.90p â€“ 4.92 percent up intraday.  According to the Financial Times, the 17 analysts projecting 12 month price targets for the FTSE 100-listed retailer, have a median target of 180.00p, with a high estimate of 325.00p and a low of 95.00p. As of 3 January 2015, the consensus forecast amongst 53 polled investment analysts covering Tesco has it that investors should hold their position in the company.\n",

REUTERS/Eric Gaillard\nBy Nqobile Dludla | JOHANNESBURG\nJOHANNESBURG South Africa's Competition Tribunal on Tuesday conditionally approved a SABMiller SAB.L and Coca-Cola (KO.N) deal to combine their African soft drink operations into what would be the continent's biggest Coke drinks bottler.\nIn a bid to fast-track the antitrust probe, SABMiller and Coca-Cola struck a deal with the South African government earlier this month that included an 800 million rand ($53 million) investment to support small businesses and a three-year freeze on layoffs.\nThe Competition Tribunal said the deal can go ahead subject to several conditions. These include the enlarged group limiting job cuts to 250, providing business skills to 25,000 black retailers and ensuring it purchases cans, glass, sugar, fruits and crates from local suppliers.\nThe Coca-Cola Beverages Africa merger parties welcomed the Competition Tribunal's approval saying in a statement they expect the transaction to complete as soon as practicable.\n\"Today's announcement ensures that the creation of Coca-Cola's largest bottling partner in Africa will strengthen our business while also closely aligning with the South African government's national imperatives for social and economic development,\" Coca-Cola Chief Operating Officer James Quincey said.\n\"This agreement marks the latest important step in that journey.\"\nBrewer SABMiller, which is in the process of being taken over by Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR), agreed in November 2014 to team up with Coke and the South African owners of local bottler Coca-Cola Sabco to create Coca-Cola Beverages Africa.\nCoca-Cola Beverages Africa, which will account for 40 percent of all Coke volumes sold in Africa, will be headquartered in South Africa, its largest market. It will have annual sales of $2.9 billion and operations in 12 markets across Southern and East Africa.\n\"Given the scope and reach of the new company, and its commitment to being headquartered in South Africa, the merger helps position the country as the undisputed economic gateway to Africa,\" Gutsche Family Investments chairman Phil Gutsche said.\nThe bottling deal was given a preliminary approval in December by South Africa's Competition Commission. The green light from the Tribunal removes the final hurdle in a drawn-out antitrust investigation.\nSouth Africa has a history of taking its time over approving deals, partly because regulators have a public interest mandate to safeguard jobs in addition to ensuring there is competition.\nThe South African Competition Commission investigates deals for any antitrust issues and recommends remedies to the Competition Tribunal, which makes a final ruling.\nUpon completion of the all-equity deal, Coke will own 11.3 percent of the venture, the Gutsche family that owns Coke Sabco 31.7 percent and SABMiller 57 percent.\nCoke has the right to buy SABMiller's stake in the new venture in the event of a change of control at the brewer, sources have told Reuters. This could be triggered by the expected takeover of SABMiller by AB InBev.\n(Editing by Alexander Smith)\n",

  "articleText" : "Add Your Note (Optional):\n \nLONDON (Alliance News) - Temporary power company Aggreko PLC on Thursday warned on the short-term outlook for its profit margin and return on capital as it undertakes a restructuring programme following a sharp fall in pretax profit in the first half.\nAggreko said its pretax profit in the six months to the end of June was down to GBP102.0 million, 21% lower than the GBP130.0 million it posted a year earlier, following a decline in its trading margin in the first half. In July, Aggreko saw its shares plunge after it issued a profit warning for 2015, saying its business was taking a heavy hit from the protracted slowdown in the US oil and gas market and from \"ongoing security challenges\" in Yemen, which is in the grips of a civil war.\nOn Thursday, Aggreko confirmed its profit guidance for the full year of GBP250 million to GBP270 million. The company posted a pretax profit of GBP289 million for 2014, down from GBP333 million in 2013, and the guidance for 2015 was below the GBP292.4 million analysts had been forecasting prior to the profit warning. According to Morningstar, consensus estimates for 2015 are now at GBP257.0 million.\nTotal revenue for Aggreko was marginally higher in the half, up to GBP781 million from GBP768 million, boosted by a rise in local business revenue, including from the delivery of the European Games. But power projects revenue was down by 9% in the half, hit by pricing pressures in Bangladesh and by a lower utilisation on its contract in Panama.\nAggreko said it will pay a flat interim dividend of 9.38 pence per share.\nAs a result of the challenges the group faces, Chief Executive Chris Weston has outlined a series of measures it will take in order to mitigate the challenges it faces, including targeting cost savings of GBP80 million in 2017, which will result in it booking exceptional costs totalling GBP30 million. As a result of the restructuring programme, Aggreko said 2016 will be a \"year of change\", with market conditions set to remain difficult and its returns and margins to take a short-term hit.\nUnder the restructuring, the company will also realign into two divisions; Aggreko Rental Solutions and Aggreko Power Solutions. Aggreko Rental Solutions will incorporate its local businesses in developed markets, while Aggreko Power Solutions will include is power projects business and its local businesses in developing markets.\nWeston said the medium-term focus for the company will be on three areas: Customer, Technology and Efficiency. The Customer portion will focus on developing its account management approach and increasing the company's capabilities in delivering complex projects. The Technology part will aim to reduce the overall cost of power for its customers, and the Efficiency portion will see the group looks to improve its processes and systems.\nInvestec analyst Andrew Gibb said the broker does not disagree with Weston's view that Aggreko remains a strong business in a market which still offers attractive growth prospects. But there are many clear near-term trading challenges the group faces and risks attached to the new strategy, Gibb added, as the broker retained a cautious stance on the stock.\n\"The performance of the group in the first half was impacted by difficult trading conditions in a number of our markets, notably Bangladesh, and external factors, including the impact of a lower oil price and ongoing security concerns in Yemen,\" said Aggreko's Weston.\n\"The performance of the group in the first half was impacted by difficult trading conditions in a number of our markets, notably Bangladesh, and external factors, including the impact of a lower oil price and ongoing security concerns in Yemen,\" Weston added. \"I am impressed by the commitment of our people and our culture, and I am confident that our new focus and structure will see the business return to growth.\"\nAggreko shares were down 1.2% to 1,173.00 pence on Thursday.\nAggreko said its local business revenue was up by 3% in the half, driven by a strong performance in Europe, Middle East and Africa on the back of the GBP13 million in revenue it booked from the European Games held in Azerbaijan in June.\nThis was offset, however, by a decline in revenue its Americas business from the slowdown in the oil and gas industry, where spending by operators is being cut in order to keep projects economically viable in a low oil price environment, and by tough comparators in Brazil, which was boosted a year earlier by the World Cup. Asia Pacific local business revenue was flat year-on-year.\nIn Aggreko's Power Projects division, revenue fell on the back of soft utilisation at its Panama project, due to higher hydro levels, while volumes declined in Indonesia and the group saw lower pricing from its contract in Bangladesh. Power projects trading in Europe, the Middle East and Africa was solid, boosted by its good order intake in Africa in 2014.\nAggreko's trading margin in the half was down to 15% from 18%. Pricing and volume pressure was felt in its oil and gas-related businesses in North America, and the group was hit by the pricing pressure it faces in Bangladesh.\nIn July, in the profit warning it issued, the company said that trading terms for gas contract extensions in Bangladesh are likely to be less favourable than its earlier expectations and, while it is taking actions to mitigate the problems, as it is on its oil and gas business in North America, this will still take a bite out of its full-year profit.\nBy Sam Unsted; samunsted@alliancenews.com; @SamUAtAlliance\nCopyright 2015 Alliance News Limited.

Standard Chartered slid as much as 13 percent, the most since 2012. London-based insurer Prudential Plc tumbled 11 percent. The Hang Seng Index was down 4.7 percent as of the midday local-time break in trading.\nFinancial markets convulsed as investors dumped the pound and equities and piled into safe-haven assets like gold and the yen. Senior bankers from JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Jamie Dimon to HSBC’s Stuart Gulliver had warned that a Brexit could cause them to move thousands of jobs from the U.K. \nBrexit “is sure to be very disruptive in the short term and a drag on economic growth and employment in the longer term -- especially for the U.K.,” said Tim Adams, the head of the Institute of International Finance, a global association of the financial industry, counting about 500 members from about 70 countries.\nJapan’s Woes\nJapanese banks plunged as a surge in the yen triggered a rout of the nation’s shares. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. dropped as much as 11 percent, the biggest intraday decline since the aftermath of Japan’s earthquake and tsunami in March 2011. Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. slid as much as 9.9 percent and Mizuho Financial Group Inc. lost 8.2 percent. Nomura Holdings Inc. tumbled 11 percent.\nHSBC, which fell on Friday to the lowest since 2009, would be hurt in any post-Brexit recession in the U.K. because of a likely jump in unemployment and slumps in housing prices and the currency, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analysts said ahead of the vote.\nThe slump in Standard Chartered’s shares contrasted with Bernstein’s more positive assessment of that bank’s prospects because of its lack of any “material” exposure to the U.K. Lloyds Banking Group Plc is the bank most tied to the British economy, followed by Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, according to the analysts.\nHSBC would probably move about 1,000 investment bankers to Paris in the event of an exit, Chief Executive Officer Gulliver said in February.\nDimon’s Take\n“If the U.K. leaves the EU, we may have no choice but to re-organize our business model here,” Dimon, the chief executive officer of JPMorgan, said this month while visiting the U.K. “Brexit could mean fewer JPMorgan jobs in the U.K. and more jobs in Europe.”\nLive coverage of the results from all parts of Britain\nThe Bloomberg Asia Pacific Banks Index, which doesn’t include the two London-based lenders, lost 3.6 percent, the most since September. \nIt was only four months ago that HSBC said it will maintain its headquarters in London, a move that helped underscore the city’s status as a global financial hub. The decision, after 10 months of deliberations, came after concessions from the U.K. government on regulation and taxes. HSBC made about a third of its 2015 revenue in Europe.\nMorgan Stanley\nAhead of the vote, Morgan Stanley indicated it could shift its local headquarters to Dublin or Frankfurt after a Brexit. Citigroup Inc. would “rebalance” its European operations, a company memo showed.\nDeutsche Bank AG chief executive officer John Cryan said last month that it would be “counter-intuitive” to trade euro zone products such as Italian government bonds out of London if Britain was no longer part of the EU.\nIn the case of HSBC, the relocated positions would be in the global banking and markets unit, which employs about 5,000 people in London, Gulliver said, citing requirements under MiFID II, the EU rules covering everything from derivatives trading to bond pricing.\nJapanese brokerage Daiwa Securities Group Inc. said it would need to set up a business in the EU that replicated or replaced some functions in London, according to a memo to employees ahead of the vote. Under European banking law, financial firms not based in the EU need an authorized presence to do business there.\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal. LEARN MORE\nRead this next\n",

They were down 4.8 percent as of 11:30 a.m. local time, extending this year’s decline to 35 percent. The benchmark Hang Seng Index slipped 0.9 percent.\nStandard Chartered is now lagging behind the Bloomberg World Banks Index by the most since the gauge started in 2003.\nWhile Chief Executive Officer Bill Winters’s measures to restructure the lender and boost capital address some of Fitch’s concerns about the bank, implementing the plan could be challenging because of credit risks and high management and staff turnover, the ratings firm said in a statement. Fitch on Thursday cut the lender’s credit rating one grade to A+ from AA-, with a negative outlook.\nJob Cuts\nWinters, who took over in June, on Tuesday unveiled 15,000 job losses to help save $2.9 billion by 2018, with the bank scrapping the second-half dividend. Standard Chartered will also restructure or exit $100 billion of assets and reduce its riskiest lending in Asia after loan impairments surged. The bank reported an unexpected third-quarter loss of $139 million, compared with a profit of $1.5 billion a year earlier.\nThe bank’s impaired-loan ratios remain above its peers’ and appear to have become more volatile as a result of concentrated sector and country exposures, Fitch said. “Standard Chartered remains vulnerable to volatility from a difficult operating and regulatory environment.”\nThe bank’s shares fell 6.3 percent in London on Thursday.\nStandard Chartered’s “ratings may be downgraded if the bank fails to strengthen earnings and reduce risks or if loan quality deterioration accelerated undermining its capital strength,” Fitch said. “Outsized fines or material business restrictions from litigation could also lead to a downgrade.”\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

  "articleText" : "Standard Chartered Misses Estimates in Sands’s Last Results\nStephen Morris and Richard Partington\nApril 28, 2015 — 4:22 AM EDT\nUpdated on\nShare on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp\nStandard Chartered Plc reported first-quarter profit that missed analysts’ estimates, with all but one division reporting lower earnings in Peter Sands’s final results as chief executive officer.\nPretax profit fell 22 percent to $1.5 billion from the year-earlier period, the London-based lender said in a statement on Tuesday. That missed the $1.6 billion average estimate of four analysts in a Bloomberg survey.\nStandard Chartered hired Bill Winters, 53, a former co-head of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s investment bank, to take over as CEO in June after Sands struggled to reverse two years of declining earnings and a slump in shares. The board has come under pressure from investors to move to Asia as U.K. taxes on banks continue to rise, with Finance Director Andy Halford saying on Tuesday that a move in domicile is “something that we continue to keep under review.”\n“We sense a bit of organizational water-treading until the new CEO Winters gets stuck in,” said Sandy Chen, an analyst at Cenkos Securities Plc in London with a buy recommendation on the shares. “Winters’ top priorities are relatively clear: clean up corporate governance and risk management in order to reduce regulatory pressures, cut costs” and “use disposals to top up capital ratios.”\nThe shares fell as much as 3.6 percent, trading at 1,090.50 pence at 12:43 p.m. in London, down 2.2 percent on the day. They have increased about 12 percent since the management overhaul was announced on Feb. 26 after losing almost half their value over the previous two years.\nLoan Impairments\nStandard Chartered’s retail operation was the only division to report rising earnings in the three months through March 31. Commercial banking income fell by 17 percent, the most of any unit, to $259 million. Income from corporate and institutional clients fell 5 percent to $2.5 billion, while private banking income decreased 4 percent to $152 million.\nLoan impairment “remains elevated” in the first quarter, especially among corporate and institutional clients, rising 80 percent to $476 million compared to last year, according to the statement. Operating expenses rose 1 percent to $2.5 billion amid “continued significant investment in improving conduct and compliance systems and processes,” the bank said.\n“Trading conditions remain challenging and the actions we are taking to de-risk, cut costs and build capital are having an impact on near-term performance,” Sands wore in the statement. “However, underlying business volumes generally remain strong.”\nThe CEO didn’t participate in the media call on Tuesday.\nBank Levy\nAdding to the bank’s cost burden, Standard Chartered could pay about $540 million toward the bank levy this year, up by about $170 million from 2014, according to Halford.\n“Such a significant increase on one line of the costs is clearly some food for thought,” Halford told analysts. “But the bank levy is one of a number of factors that one would take into account when looking at the most appropriate place to be domiciled. We will continue to keep this under review -- no current plans to do anything different.”\nHSBC Holdings Plc, which paid 750 million pounds ($1.4 billion) in bank levies last year, the most among major British lenders, has also said it’s reviewing whether to leave London, just days before an election next month.\nThe bank is “on schedule” to increase its common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of financial strength, to between 11 and 12 percent and save more than $400 million under a cost reduction program this year, according to Sands. The capital ratio was 10.7 percent at the end of December.\nNew Management\nUnder Sands, the lender reported a 30 percent slump in pretax profit in 2014, hurt by faltering economic growth in Asia, plummeting commodity prices and rising costs tied to misconduct such as the rigging of global currency markets. The bank is eliminating some 4,000 jobs and shutting equities trading to save about $1.8 billion in costs through 2017.\nAmong the new CEO’s tasks will be choosing a new management team. Executives to leave this year include Asia CEO Jaspal Bindra and Viswanathan Shankar, head of Europe, Middle East, Africa and Americas. Chairman John Peace also plans to step down in 2016.\nStandard Chartered is the first of Britain’s five largest lenders to release first-quarter results.\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

  "articleText" : "Will Capex, Dividend Cuts Help BHP Survive Prolonged Downturn? PART 4 OF 10\nCan BHP Billiton’s Productivity Drive Down Copper Costs?\nBy Annie Gilroy  | Feb 25, 2016    12:25 pm EST\nCopper costs\nUnit cash production costs are a key metric for investors in the metals and mining space ( XME ). This assumes additional significance in the face of the current low commodity price environment. BHP Billiton ( BHP ) ( BBL ) and its peers in the copper space are improving productivity in order to lower unit costs.\nIn this article, we’ll explore this topic in detail. Copper contributes 25% of BHP’s revenues.\nLower unit production cost\nCash costs for copper fell 8% year-over-year (or YoY) in the first half of fiscal 2016 to $1.11 per pound on an Escondida grade-adjusted basis.\nThe decline in costs reflects productivity-led cost improvements and a further reduction in labor and contractor costs. These improvements were particularly visible at Olympic Dam, where unit costs declined by 34% YoY.\nEBIT (earnings before interest and tax), however, declined by $.17 billion YoY, mainly due to lower realized copper prices and lower grades at its Escondida mine in Chile.\nRio Tinto’s ( RIO ) costs for copper also declined YoY for the second half of fiscal 2015 results, which ended June 30, 2015. This was mainly due to cost savings at Oyu Tolgoi and Escondida.\nWhat will drive copper costs?\nAt Escondida, additional material will be moved in fiscal 2016 to mitigate the impact of grade decline. BHP expects unit costs to fall further to $0.87 per pound due to further productivity realizations.\nIn the longer term, BHP management sees a deficit emerging in copper supply. This could happen as grades decline and scarcity of high-quality future development opportunities keep the industry’s supply constrained.\nIn the short to medium term, however, copper prices seem to be under pressure due to weaker-than-expected demand and the strengthening US dollar ( USDU ). This has caused share prices for Freeport-McMoRan ( FCX ), Teck Resources (TCK), and Southern Copper ( SCCO ) to hit multiyear lows in recent weeks. The slowdown in China ( MCHI ) ( FXI ), the biggest copper consumer, has weighed heavily on copper prices. FCX forms 3% of the SPDR Metals and Mining ETF ( XME ).\nIn the next part of this series, we’ll see how BHP is progressing on the cost front in its petroleum division.\n{\"metrics\":[\"Open\"],\"tickers\":[\"BHP\",\"FCX\",\"MCHI\",\"TCK\",\"USDU\"],\"ticker_names\":[\"BHP Billiton Limited (ADR)\",\"Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc.\",\"iShares MSCI China Index Fund\",null,\"WisdomTree Bloomberg US Dllr Bullish ETF\"]}\nX\n",

  "articleText" : "Swiss miner and trader sold shares at 125 pence apiece\nSale is part of debt-reduction plan announced last week\nShare on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp\nGlencore Plc, the worst performer on the U.K.’s benchmark stock index this year, sold $2.5 billion of new shares to pay down debt to help protect its credit rating amid a rout in commodities prices.\nGlencore sold the stock at 125 pence a share, a 2.4 percent discount to the closing price on Tuesday, the Baar, Switzerland-based commodities trader and miner said in a statement. Chief Executive Officer Ivan Glasenberg paid about $210 million to buy stock in the sale in order to maintain his 8.4 percent stake, honoring a commitment that he and other senior managers representing 22 percent of the company wouldn’t dilute their holdings.\nGlasenberg is responding to investor concern that a debt-laden balance sheet can’t withstand the slump in commodity prices. The share sale, the largest of its kind in the mining industry in Europe, is part of a wider $10 billion debt-reduction program announced last week, which saw the company scrap dividends and plan asset sales to cut its $30 billion of borrowings.\n“The company appears to be moving quickly to make its outlined restructuring so it can get on with business,” Investec Plc analysts wrote in a note to clients. It’s “a sensible move” and Glencore “has elected to push ahead rapidly in order to remove uncertainty,” they said.\nInvestor Harris Associates LP took advantage of recent weakness in Glencore’s stock to boost its holding to 5.5 percent before the sale, which would make it the third-biggest shareholder, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Harris bought shares in the offering to maintain its holding at that level, David Herro, chief investment officer for international stocks, said by e-mail.\nThe shares rose 5.2 percent in London to close at 134.70 pence, valuing the company at about $27 billion. The sale tops Xstrata Plc’s $2.45 billion offering in 2006 as the biggest placement of its kind in the European mining industry, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nThe stock touched 118.1 pence on Tuesday, the lowest price since the company’s $10 billion initial public offering in 2011. Its Hong Kong-traded shares tumbled 7.6 percent that day to close at a record low of HK$14.80. They were suspended Wednesday pending the share-sale announcement.\nThe measures will ease balance sheet concerns but they “do not provide longer-term equity investors with any confidence on the equity story for the company,” Rob Clifford, an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG in London, wrote in a report Wednesday. “The key task for the management team in our view is to rebuild the equity story post the significant under-performance, dilution and dividend cut.”\nGlencore Stock Price\nMoody’s Investors Service cut its outlook to negative on Glencore last week and affirmed the company’s Baa2 debt rating. A week earlier, Standard & Poor’s reduced its outlook on Glencore’s BBB level to negative, saying China’s slowing economy will continue to weigh on copper and aluminum prices, which are near six-year lows.\nGlencore said in an earlier statement that it would offer stakes to both new and existing investors. Wednesday’s announcement didn’t disclose whether any new investors took part in the offering.\nPeter Grauer, the chairman of Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, is a senior independent non-executive director at Glencore.\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

(AP) — Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway reported a 37 percent drop in its second-quarter profit as the paper value of its investments fell and its insurance companies reported an underwriting loss.\nBerkshire Hathaway’s net income fell to $4.01 billion, or $2,442 per Class A share. That’s down from last year’s $6.4 billion, or $3,889 per share. Those results were helped by a $1.1 billion paper gain on a stock exchange deal.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\nRevenue grew 3 percent to $51.4 billion.\nThe four analysts surveyed by FactSet expected Berkshire to report operating earnings per Class A share of $2,997.14. By that measure Berkshire reported per share profit of $2,367, down from $2,634.\nBuffett recommends investors pay more attention to Berkshire’s quarterly operating earnings because they exclude the swings in the value of investments and derivatives, which can vary greatly from quarter to quarter.\nBerkshire’s investments and derivatives added $123 million this quarter, compared to last year’s $2.06 billion. A year ago, Berkshire traded most of its Graham Holdings stock for Miami-based television station WPLG, some Berkshire stock and cash.\nBerkshire officials do not typically comment on their quarterly earnings reports, and they did not immediately respond to an interview request on Friday.\nBerkshire’s latest major deal that created the Kraft Heinz Food Co. closed just after the second quarter ended, so it’s not reflected in these results. But Berkshire said it expects to record a $7 billion gain on the Kraft deal in the third quarter.\nBerkshire teamed up with the Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital to acquire Kraft through their ketchup maker H.J. Heinz. The deal created one of the world’s largest food companies with annual revenue of about $28 billion. Berkshire owns 27 percent of the new Kraft Heinz.\nAndy Kilpatrick, who wrote “Of Permanent Value: The Story of Warren Buffett,” said the Kraft deal will make up for the rough second-quarter results.\n“That’s the real positive of the year, and that will come in the third quarter,” Kilpatrick said.\nBerkshire’s insurance companies, which include Geico and General Reinsurance, reported a $38 million underwriting loss compared to last year’s $411 million gain. The negative swing was driven by higher claims at Geico and $115 million in storm losses in Australia that Berkshire insured.\nBerkshire said Geico customers may see rate increases as a result of the increase in claims.\nBerkshire’s BNSF railroad generated $963 million net income, up from $916 a year ago, despite relatively flat volume and weaker demand for coal and crude oil shipments.\nThe company’s utility subsidiary, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, generated $502 million net income, up from $375 million last year. The utility unit was helped by last year’s acquisition of Canadian power transmission company Altalink and by higher electricity rates in Iowa.\nBesides insurance and railroad companies, Berkshire owns utility, clothing, furniture, brick, carpet, jewelry and pilot training firms. It also has major investments in such companies as Coca-Cola, IBM and Wells Fargo & Co.\nRead More Stories About:\nComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

  "articleURL" : "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-01-20/bp-judge-urged-by-u-s-to-impose-11-7-billion-plus-spill-fine",
  "articleText" : "Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp\nBP Plc’s exploration unit should be fined at least $11.7 billion, or more than triple what the company set aside, for its role in causing the largest offshore oil spill in U.S. history, a government lawyer told the judge who will determine the penalty.\nAnadarko Petroleum Corp., owner of 25 percent of the doomed Macondo well that blew out in April 2010, should be fined more than $1 billion, Justice Department lawyer Steven O’Rourke said today at the trial in federal court in New Orleans.\n“The penalty is going to have to be high enough for companies of their size to even notice it, but not high enough to be ruinous to their operations,” O’Rourke told U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier in his opening statement. “It has to be high enough so massive companies like Anadarko and BP will be deterred.”\nBarbier is conducting a three-week trial without a jury to consider Clean Water Act fines against BP and Anadarko. BP is facing a maximum potential fine of $13.7 billion. The U.S. isn’t asking for the maximum fine of $3.5 billion from Anadarko.\nBP says it doesn’t deserve massive Clean Water Act fines because of its efforts responding to the spill and minimizing the impact.\nBP’s exploration unit from the day of the spill “immediately committed resources to capturing the oil, burning the oil, skimming the oil,” Mike Brock, a company lawyer, told Barbier today.\nFearing Worst\n“Before we even knew that the well was flowing, BP was marshaling resources to prepare for the worst,” Brock said. “It was good work that the Coast Guard and BP did together, and it significantly changed the outcome to the environment.”\nBP deserved high marks for its response to the spill, U.S. Coast Guard Admiral Meredith Austin testified at today’s trial as the government’s first witness.\n“I think BP did a pretty good job,” she said. “I’d give it a B-plus or an A.”\nThe effort, however, drained the Coast Guard’s ability to respond to another event, Austin said. At its peak, 14 percent of the Coast Guard was committed to the spill, said Austin, deputy incident commander.\nFifty percent of the Guard’s reserves were activated, so they couldn’t have been called up for another two years, she said. In another “natural disaster or man-made disaster, they wouldn’t be available,” she said.\nUpbeat E-Mail\nDuring cross-examination, Brock produced an e-mail Austin sent to colleagues during the response, in which she said: “Don’t believe what you see on the news. We are working hard and keeping the vast majority of oil off the beach.”\n“You knew what was being represented on TV was an exaggeration of what was happening in the marshes?” Brock asked.\n“Correct,” she answered.\nThe blowout of the well off the coast of Louisiana in April 2010 killed 11 people aboard the rig and spewed oil for almost three months into waters that touch the shores of five states. The accident sparked thousands of lawsuits against BP, as well as Vernier, Switzerland-based Transocean Ltd., owner of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig, and Houston-based Halliburton Co., which provided cementing services for the project.\nThe proceeding beginning today is the third phase of U.S. trials over the spill.\nIn the first phase, Barbier determined that BP was grossly negligent before the well blowout, allowing for potential pollution fines to be almost quadrupled. The second phase ended with last week’s decision that the U.S. overestimated the size of the spill, reducing the possible fine. The judge also gave BP credit for capturing oil as it spewed from the sea floor.\nEight Criteria\nIn the penalty phase, Barbier will consider eight criteria in setting the fine, including the seriousness of the violation, the degree of culpability, any history of prior violations, any other penalties for the same incident, and what BP has done to minimize or mitigate the effects of the spill.\nBarbier previously ruled Anadarko wasn’t responsible for the spill and is on the hook for pollution fines only as a part-owner of the well. Anadarko has argued it shouldn’t pay a pollution fine because it had no fault in the spill and paid $4 billion in a settlement with BP, with the money earmarked for claims to those harmed by the spill.\n“We dispute that Anadarko should be punished for acts it did not take and acts it did not control,” Ky E. Kirby, an Anadarko attorney, told Barbier today.\nThe trial is expected to last three weeks, with no decision until after BP and the U.S. Justice Department file post-trial suggested findings in April.\nCompany’s Costs\nThe London-based company has set aside $3.5 billion to cover the pollution fines. The company has spent almost $34 billion in spill response, cleanup, penalties and claims, Brock said at today’s trial. The payments include much of a $4.5 billion settlement of criminal allegations BP reached in 2012.\nThe company had taken a $43 billion pretax charge to cover all the costs, according to an Oct. 28 earnings statement. The ultimate cost is “subject to significant uncertainty,” BP said in the statement.\nThe possibility of a fine higher than $3.5 billion doesn’t require a greater reserve because BP still hasn’t spent or committed to spend the $43 billion set aside, said Fadel Gheit, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. “The provision of $43 billion has $7.6 billion of breathing room,” he said.\nGheit said he expects the fine to be no higher than $9.2 billion. It may be as low as $3.5 billion, he said. BP deserves credit for its response to the spill, which should bring down the ultimate fine, Gheit said.\nSettlement Possibility\nBP and the U.S. may settle before Barbier rules on the fines, said David Berg, a Houston lawyer who has been following the litigation.\n“There’s a very good chance -- about 75 percent -- that they’ll settle,” Berg said in an interview. Even if the case doesn’t settle before a trial verdict, BP probably won’t face a maximum fine, Berg said. The range will probably be from $8 billion to $10 billion, he said.\nEven a fine of $3.5 billion would be the largest civil penalty under the Clean Water Act, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The current record is the $1 billion settlement Transocean reached with the U.S. in 2013 over the Gulf spill.\n67% Fault\nIn his September ruling that BP’s exploration unit acted with gross negligence, Barbier apportioned fault at 67 percent for BP, 30 percent for Transocean and 3 percent for Halliburton. He found that Transocean and Halliburton were merely negligent. That decision triggered BP’s exposure to maximum Clean Water Act fines of $4,300 for each barrel spilled. The maximum otherwise would have been $1,100 a barrel. BP has appealed that decision.\nThe Jan. 15 ruling on the number of barrels spilled included a finding that the company didn’t extend the spill by lying about its size or misrepresenting the efforts to contain it. Barbier determined that BP also wasn’t grossly negligent or reckless “in source control planning and preparation.”\nThe penalty sought by the U.S. is “a gross outlier compared to penalties in any other case or settlement,” BP said in court papers Dec. 19. “Even in cases involving serious environmental harm or highly culpable conduct, courts frequently affirm CWA penalties that are a small percentage of the statutory maximum.”\nPast Penalties\nBP cited multiple cases in which judges set penalties “well below the statutory maximums,” the company said. Most were below 10 percent of the maximum fines and several were less than 1 percent, BP said.\nIgnoring the spill response by BP’s exploration unit in determining the fines is “bad public policy,” the company said in court papers. “If the U.S.’s position is adopted, future violators would have a disincentive to engage in a robust response.”\nThe environmental impact of the spill was much less than expected, Brock, BP’s lawyer, told Barbier today.\n“We now have a massive amount of data that demonstrates that the Gulf did not suffer what was feared in April, May, June and July of 2010,” Brock said. “There has been no collapse of the ecosystem.”\nBP also asked Barbier to take into consideration the economic effect on the company’s exploration unit if a large fine is imposed, particularly as the price of oil has fallen to less than $50 a barrel.\nThe oil price drop has caused the value of BP’s exploration unit’s assets to plummet, Brock, the company lawyer, told Barbier today.\n“We’ve had a significant change in the price of the commodity because of oversupply,” Brock said.\nFine’s Impact\nBrock posted on a projector in the courtroom an excerpt from an assessment by an expert for BP’s exploration unit, which read: “A penalty in excess of $2.3 billion in 2015 would exhaust BPXP’s projected available funds in 2015.\n‘‘Is there any reason that any penalties couldn’t be paid over a number of years?” Barbier asked Brock.\nBrock said he didn’t know. O’Rourke, the U.S. lawyer, said he knew of one case in the past where penalties were spread out over years.\nThe U.S. said in court papers before Barbier issued his decision on the size of the spill that it was seeking $16 billion to $18 billion from BP’s exploration unit. The U.S. based that amount on a spill of 4.2 million barrels.\nMaximum Sought\n“If ever there was a case that merits the statutory maximum, this is it,” Justice Department lawyers said in a Dec. 19 filing.\nBP and Anadarko haven’t accepted that “this extremely serious violation of law deserves a commensurate penalty,” O’Rourke, the government lawyer told Barbier today.\nThe spill disrupted livelihoods and patterns of daily living and increased social and economic inequality, anthropologist Diane Austin testified today. Austin, a professor at the University of Arizona in Tucson, led a team of anthropologists in a 15-month study into the effects of the spill on the Gulf community.\n“This disaster caused widespread destruction across all of the economic sectors we studied,” said Austin, the government’s second witness.\n“As soon as there is information out that there is oil gushing into the gulf, people cancel their hotel rooms, they cancel their charter fishing trips,” she said. “When all of these economic sectors went down at the same time, it had a huge effect.”\nWhile BP hired workers to help with the response and clean-up and paid claims, this didn’t aid everyone in the region, Austin said under cross-examination.\n“Many people benefited and many people did not,” she said. “It is that disparity that generates sociocultural harm.”\nThe case is In re Oil Spill by the Oil Rig Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20, 2010, MDL-2179, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana (New Orleans).\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Make your car more fuel-efficient. You can do this by keeping your tyres inflated, taking the roof rack off, emptying your car of clutter and turning off your air con when driving at lower speeds.\n2. Drive more efficiently. Some ways to do this, include:\n– Accelerate gradually without over-revving\n– Always drive on the highest possible gear\n– If you can, allow your car to slow down naturally as your brake is a money burner\n– Re-starting your car is expensive, if you can keep moving\n3. Find the cheapest fuel prices. Use PetrolPrices.com. All you need to do is enter in your postcode and tell it how far you want to travel (up to 20 miles).\nHoward Cox, FairFuel UK co-founder told the Sun this morning: “Asda as usual is the first to cut pump prices significantly.\n“This welcome kick-start to fairer pump prices must make other retailers follow, albeit it has been a long time coming with wholesalers deliberately not passing at least 4p to millions of hard-working drivers in October.”\nRAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “While this level of cut is clearly good news it has come far too late as the wholesale price of fuel has been falling since the end of October when the oil price began to fall again.\n“Retailers should have reduced their prices then rather than making one bigger headline-grabbing cut now. The RAC called for a cut last week so it’s a case of better late than never.\n“The first two weeks of November unfortunately prove that the ‘rocket and feather’ does exist. This is a great shame as retailers previously had a good record of lowering their prices in response to wholesale cost savings.”\nWe pay for your stories!

  "articleText" : "11 May 2014\nNow, however, that could all be about to change.\nAfter repeated extensions to the consultation process , Lancashire County Council’s planning officer is this week expected to issue his recommendation on Cuadrilla’s applications - some 4,500 pages each - to drill and frack for shale gas at two sites between Blackpool and Preston.\nNext week, councillors are due to vote on the proposals, the first for fracking in the UK since earth tremors caused by Cuadrilla in 2011 led to a temporary ban on the practice.\nThe whole planning process will have taken eight months for one site and seven-and-a-half months for the other – roughly double the timescale Cuadrilla had expected.\nEgan, 53, is plainly frustrated by the delays but careful to be diplomatic ahead of the crucial votes. “I guess the council are doing a thorough job,” he offers.\n“Clearly we would like it to take a shorter period. Sixteen weeks is the typical recommended period for an environmental impact assessment application but I understand these are the first ones so people are cautious.\n“It’s a difficult birth,” he says with a laugh. “We will need to sit down at the end of this and take a look at why it took so long.”\nIf planning permission is granted – and a series of outstanding permits issued by the Environment Agency, which has also taken far longer than expected - Egan anticipates it will take until April to begin construction at the sites and it will be the middle of the year before they start drilling the wells.\nAs for actually fracking – pumping water, sand and chemicals down the wells to hydraulically fracture rocks and extract gas trapped within them? That could “just about start at the end of the year”.\nSimply getting fracking going will, Egan hopes, help win the battle of public opinion over the controversial process and smooth the way for future applications.\n“Once you get started at least you can point to a physical site with operations that people can go and observe, measure, touch, feel, see. I think that will make quite a difference to explaining what it is - and probably more importantly, what it isn’t,” he says.\nAn artist's impression of the fracking site at Preston New Road\nThe residents of Roseacre and Little Plumpton, the villages closest to the proposed fracking sites, have what Egan regards as understandable concerns about typical planning issues such as traffic and noise.\nBut Egan says they have also been subjected to \"scaremongering” by opponents; the distribution of “publications that frighten people; people being told they are going to get cancer”.\n“I get quite angry about it frankly. If people want to object to it I have no issue with that, but if they are preying on people’s fears in an unfounded way then I think that’s completely irresponsible,” he says.\n“We have gone through a very thorough environmental process. Some of the claims, that we are going to put hundreds of toxic chemicals in the frack fluid, have been well and truly aired and discredited or demolished because the Environment Agency approved the fluid. It has one non-hazardous chemical.”\nCuadrilla's proposed fracking sites\nOpposition to fracking has become something of a cause célèbre. Sir Paul McCartney, Vivenne Westwood and Russell Brand were among 150 signatories to a letter by the “Talk Fracking” campaign last summer, calling on ministers to “suspend fracking immediately while a genuinely independent, balanced and thorough public debate is held on the potential dangers this industry holds for the UK”.\n“What’s an 'independent debate’? Six months’ worth of public consultation - that’s not independent?” Egan asks, chuckling incredulously.\n“Suspension of what fracking? We haven’t had any fracking since 2011! I just take it with a pinch of salt – when someone calls for an immediate suspension of fracking, when there is no fracking.”\nSo would he be willing to go head to head with Brand – the self-styled revolutionary who last year urged his millions of Twitter followers to “get off the sofa and join the debate” on fracking?\n“I am interested in actually getting something done in Lancashire,” Egan says earnestly. “If debating Russell Brand helps us getting something done in Lancashire, which I very much doubt it will, then fine.”\nThe Irishman breaks into laughter as he wonders: “Has Russell Brand ever been to Lancashire?”\n&lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: Russell Brand - Future generations in the UK are at risk. Get off the sofa and join the debate. I am. &lt;a href=\"http://t.co/RsBg4Hw2F5\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;http://t.co/RsBg4Hw2F5&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&amp;q=%23talkfracking\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;#talkfracking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/noframe&gt;\nDespite the circus that has grown up around fracking, Egan maintains the potential prize – 200 trillion cubic feet of gas estimated to lie within Cuadrilla’s Lancashire exploration licence alone - is worth all the hassle.\n“If you look at the resource, it is huge. The demand is huge. The indigenous supply from the North Sea is dwindling fast. It’s absolutely essential for the UK in my opinion, or else we just import it. Where else are we going to get our heating from?”\nThe decline of the North Sea has appeared all the more precipitous in recent weeks as the plunging oil price sees majors such as BP scaling back investment and laying off workers.\nThe UK gas price, too, while not strictly linked to the oil price, has fallen in recent months after two winters of mild weather. At recent levels of about 46p per therm, analysis by Greenpeace points out, the gas price is now lower than the likely break-even prices many experts have cited for UK shale gas development.\nEgan gives this short shrift. “I have worked in this industry for 30 years. We don’t make decisions on today’s prices.\n“I love these commentators that say: 'Yesterday we were going to cover Lancashire in sites and today its uneconomic.’ This resource, if it does get developed, will get developed over 20, 30 maybe 40 years.”\nFrancis Egan pictured at one of the proposed fracking sites (pic: Warren Smith)\nEgan says that, in the longer term, low prices hinder the oil and gas industry by making it harder to raise funding. But Cuadrilla’s current exploration programme is already funded thanks to a £160m deal in 2013 with British Gas owner Centrica.\nAnd as Cuadrilla isn’t producing any gas or oil, much as it would like to be - and probably won’t be on a commercial scale until 2019-20 - it has no revenues to be hit by the price slump.\n“In the short term it’s actually quite good because the prices of materials and services are reducing very significantly,” Egan says. “Contractors earning 20pc less in Aberdeen in January than December – that feeds straight through to the prices services companies offer us for drilling and fracturing.”\nHe is bemused by the idea there is some kind of “magic number” below which oil and gas extraction becomes uneconomic and above which “we are in clover”.\n“The industry doesn’t work like that,” he says. “There’s no such thing as a break-even gas price. Cost of extraction is a function of the cost of people and services. As prices in the market come down, the cost of people and services come down - so the break-even price comes down.”\nBesides, trying to come up with any estimate is somewhat premature when no fracking has actually taken place. “We have no idea. We haven’t drilled and tested one single well in the UK and people would like to know what the break-even price is.\n“The first thing we have to do before we get too excited about price is assess how much gas is going to come out of the ground.”\nEnabling that to happen remains, for now, up to the planning officer and committee at Lancashire County Council.\n“I don’t know what the decisions are going to be,” Egan says. “If they are positive we will get on and do it. If they are not positive we will have to take a look and see why - it won’t mean we are walking away from it,” he vows.\nEven after all this waiting? “Especially after all this waiting.”\n \n",

  "articleText" : "Technology News | Mon Feb 29, 2016 | 2:44pm EST\nAmazon to attack UK grocery market with Morrisons deal\nBy James Davey and Kate Holton | LONDON\nLONDON Amazon has launched its biggest foray into food outside of the United States with a deal with British supermarket Morrisons to offer fresh and frozen goods to customers, in some places as quickly as under one hour.\nEnabling the online retail giant to compete with Britain's biggest supermarket stores and smallest local shops, the deal opens another front on Amazon's assault on the 178 billion pounds ($247 billion) British grocery market, already hammered by a brutal price war and changing shopping habits.\nAmazon will now add hundreds of fresh and frozen products to its existing offering of packaged grocery goods, setting it up to take on Tesco, Sainsbury's and Wal-Mart's Asda, as well as online specialist Ocado, in one of the world's most developed online retail markets.\n\"The advance of Amazon as a participant in UK grocery is a potential challenge to the whole trade, in time,\" Shore Capital retail analyst Clive Black said on Monday. \"Any new entrant is, but particularly the American behemoth.\"\nThe tie-up boosted shares of Morrisons, Britain's fourth largest supermarket, which has been a laggard in online sales. Since 2013 it has outsourced logistics for its own online food business to Ocado.\nMorrisons shares rose 5.6 percent. Those of Ocado fell 9.3 percent on fears the deal would increase competition and reduce the likelihood that Amazon could one day buy it. Market leader Tesco's shares fell by 3 percent.\n\"Tesco could soon be about to find out what it's like to be David rather than Goliath,\" said Retail Vision consultant John Ibbotson. Amazon has a market cap of $261 billion.\nThe UK grocery market has been convulsed in recent years by thrifty shoppers turning to discounters Aldi and Lidl, convenience stores and online shops. The British Retail Consortium predicts that 900,000 retail jobs could go by 2025 as the industry moves online.\nAmazon, the world's largest online retailer, launched a fresh food offering in Seattle in 2007 and has moved to a handful of other U.S. cities since then, but it has struggled to find the best pricing model, with fresh food proving one of the toughest nuts to crack.\nAfter waiving the membership fee for several years, Amazon finally said last year it would begin charging customers $299 a year for its Prime Fresh membership in the U.S.\nIts expansion into food in the rest of the world has focused so far just on packaged goods due to the complexity of delivering fresh and frozen products. However, it is keen to extend its offering, just as supermarkets are increasingly competing on its home turf by selling more non-food products online.\nRANGE LIMITATION\nThe Morrisons tie-up stops short of replicating its broader U.S. Amazon Fresh service, which offers about 20,000 chilled, frozen and perishable products and items from local shops that analysts have long speculated Amazon was targeting for the UK.\nBut it gives Amazon a platform to attack a UK online grocery market predicted to nearly double to 17.2 billion pounds in the five years to 2020, according to industry research group IGD.\nIt has offered some food and drink items to British customers since 2010, and in November it extended a packaged groceries offer already available in Germany and Japan to Amazon Prime subscription members in Britain. Last year it added a small range of chilled and frozen items to its Prime Now service which offers one-hour delivery in Britain's two biggest cities.\nAmazon has also begun surveying UK customers about their use of restaurant delivery services, in what analysts said was likely the first step in an international expansion of a business it rolled out in the U.S last September.\nMorrisons, with a smaller footprint in the more affluent areas of London and the south east of England than Tesco and Sainsbury's, may have gambled that it could cope better with the arrival of Amazon which would typically target those areas.\nMorrisons makes half of all the own brand and fresh food it sells, a greater share than other British supermarkets, and has spare capacity to service Amazon's needs.\nMorrisons announced separate plans on Monday to extend its own online grocery deliveries to the whole of the UK, in agreement with Ocado. It would take space in a new Ocado London warehouse while Ocado will provide Morrisons with software to fulfill online orders from its own stores.\nFor Morrisons, a tie-up with outside giants like Amazon might be described as \"letting the barbarians in\", said analysts at brokerage Bernstein.\nNevertheless, the deal could be \"a convenient divide-and conquer outcome where Amazon and Morrisons specialize where they are best and support each other mutually,\" Bernstein said.\n\"Morrisons may feel that Amazon isn't really a threat for its smaller stores in the North of England; on the contrary on our recent store visit, we saw a nice new shiny Amazon locker unit for picking up Amazon parcels.\"\n($1 = 0.7212 pounds)\n(Additional reporting by Emma Thomasson in Berlin and Mari Saito in San Francisco; Editing by Peter Graff)\nEmployees of Amazon India are seen behind a glass bearing the company's logo inside its office in Bengaluru, India, August 14, 2015.

  "articleText" : "Financials | Thu Nov 26, 2015 | 8:55am EST\nUPDATE 3-Barclays fined for lax crime checks in 'deal of century'\n* Fine relates to 1.9 bln stg transaction for rich clients\n* FCA declines to name clients involved in transaction\n* Bank kept documents in safe to avoid electronic storage\n* Seventh significant fine from UK watchdog in 6 years   (Adds details)\nBy Steve Slater and Huw Jones\nLONDON, Nov 26 Britain's financial watchdog has fined Barclays 72 million pounds ($109 million) for cutting corners in vetting wealthy customers in order to win a huge transaction described by one senior manager as potentially the \"deal of the century.\"\nBarclays arranged the 1.9 billion pound transaction in 2011 and 2012 for a number of rich clients deemed by the regulator to be politically exposed persons (PEPs), or people holding prominent positions that could be open to financial abuse.\nThat should require a bank to conduct more detailed checks on them, but Barclays failed to do so and in fact cut corners with its compliance procedures, Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said in a damning report on Thursday.\n\"Barclays did not follow its standard procedures, preferring instead to take on the clients as quickly as possible and thereby generated 52.3 million pounds in revenue,\" the FCA said.\nIt said the bank took unusual steps to keep the details of the clients and the transaction off its computer system, where it would normally be recorded.\nThese included buying a safe specifically for storing some documents relating to the clients and agreeing to pay the clients 37.7 million pounds if their names were ever revealed.\n\"Barclays went to significant lengths to accommodate the client to ensure that it won their business,\" the FCA said in a 37-page notice on the bank's failings.\n\"Barclays' approach was to request information only if it was absolutely necessary and did not want to 'irritate' the clients with multiple requests,\" it added.\nJust over 52 million pounds of the penalty comprised disgorgement, meaning clawing back the profit Barclays made on the transaction. That is the largest disgorgement penalty ever imposed by the FCA.\nThe watchdog made no criticism of the clients, and gave few clues on their identity. It said Barclays described their wealth as coming from \"landholdings, real estate and business and commercial activities.\"\nBarclays, which received a 30 percent discount on the fine for settling early, said the FCA made no finding that the bank facilitated any financial crime in relation to the transaction or the clients on whose behalf it was executed.\n\"Barclays has cooperated fully with the FCA throughout and continues to apply significant resources and training to ensure compliance with all legal and regulatory requirements,\" it said.\nThe FCA said the failings were not identified by Barclays, however. It was only after the regulator discussed the transaction with the bank that it gathered more information on the relationship with the clients.\nThe deal's size meant \"very significant\" harm could have been done to the integrity of the UK finance system and society if it had been related to criminal activity, the FCA said.\n\"ELEPHANT DEAL\"\nThe fine is the seventh significant penalty imposed on Barclays by Britain's regulator in the past six years, including penalties for allegedly manipulating Libor interest rates and foreign exchange prices.\nThe series of scandals means improving standards and culture will be a key task of the bank's new Chief Executive Jes Staley, who starts on Tuesday.\nThe FCA said several members of Barclays' senior management were aware of and endorsed the transaction, and said five individuals were identified as giving part approval for it, but it did not name any individuals at fault.\nIt said the bank set up \"a select team\", including senior managers, to carry out checks and arrange and execute the deal, which was known by those involved within Barclays as an \"elephant deal\" because of its size.\nBob Diamond was the chief executive of Barclays from the start of 2011 until he left in July 2012. The head of its wealth management business in 2011 and 2012, which oversees dealings with rich clients, was Tom Kalaris. He stepped down in May 2013.\nA spokesman for Diamond declined to comment, while Kalaris could not immediately be reached for comment.\nThe deal was the largest Barclays had ever executed for wealthy clients and in its early stages one senior manager said it could be \"the deal of the century,\" according to the FCA.\nThe bank failed to establish adequately the purpose and nature of the deal and did not sufficiently corroborate the clients' stated source of wealth and source of funds for the transaction, the FCA said.\nIt was a structured finance deal comprising investments in notes backed by underlying warrants and third party bonds. The aim was to deliver a specific rate of income with a full guarantee on the capital over a number of decades.\nThe regulator listed nine features that should have raised red flags for Barclays, including its complex structure involving offshore companies, and that at one point clients requested Barclays make a payment of several tens of millions of dollars to a third party, which was not made.\n(Editing by Mark Potter)\n",

Financial terms were not disclosed.\n“It’s a sensible bit of tidying up,” said Wyn Ellis, an analyst at Numis Securities. Diageo can reinvest the proceeds from a sale elsewhere, Ellis said, noting that the company’s main priorities are returning its U.S. division to growth and reducing excess inventory held by wholesalers.\nGleneagles, a luxury resort and golf venue in the county of Perth, Scotland, was acquired by Diageo in 1984 and has been a target for divestment since 1998, according to The Times newspaper. In 2001, Diageo rejected an informal 90 million-pound ($141 million) offer for the property, it said.\nIn addition to last year’s Ryder Cup, the hotel is the venue for Diageo’s annual Johnnie Walker Championship golf tournament and has hosted political gatherings including the Bilderberg Conference and the G8 summit.\nThe hotel had operating profit of 2.6 million pounds and sales of 43.5 million pounds in the 12 months through June 2014.\n“Following the success of the Ryder Cup we feel this is an appropriate time to realize value,” Diageo Chief Executive Officer Ivan Menezes said in the statement.\nAnother possible candidate for divestment is the company’s wine business. Diageo said this year it has reviewed expressions of interest for the unit, which includes Blossom Hill and Yellow Tail.\n“A sale of the wine business is undoubtedly a possibility,” Numis’s Ellis said. “There’s a bit of tidying up left to do in the portfolio.”\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

REUTERS/Luke MacGregor\nLONDON Taxpayer-backed Lloyds Banking Group (LLOY.L) said on Thursday it was cutting around 945 jobs in a restructuring plan first outlined a year ago with the aim of reducing the bank's workforce by 9,000.\nThe staff affected are currently employed within the bank's retail, commercial banking and consumer finance teams, and in several back office divisions, the bank said.\nEurope's second-biggest bank by market value said it planned to cut around 9,000 roles - roughly 10 percent of its workforce - in October 2014, in response to the increasing popularity of online banking and the automation of some back office functions.\n\"The group's policy is always to use natural turnover and to redeploy people wherever possible to retain their expertise and knowledge within the group,\" the bank said in a statement. \n\"Where it is necessary for employees to leave the company, it will look to achieve this by offering voluntary redundancy. Compulsory redundancies will always be a last resort.\"\nIt said recognised unions Accord and Unite were consulted prior to the announcement and will continue to be consulted.\nRob MacGregor, Unite's National Officer for Finance, said the bank had committed to providing alternative jobs, voluntary redundancy and voluntary job swapping to those employees affected where possible.\n\"We will make sure the bank keep to these commitments, while continuing to consult and support our members,\" he said in a statement.\nLloyds was rescued with a 20.5 billion pound taxpayer-funded bailout during the 2007-09 financial crisis, leaving the state holding 43 percent. The government has since reduced its holding to less than 10 percent, raising around 16 billion pounds for the public purse.\nThe bank reported weaker than expected third-quarter results last month, and set aside another 500 million pounds to compensate customers mis-sold loan insurance, bringing its total compensation bill to nearly 14 billion pounds, more than double that of any other bank.\nThe government is planning to sell at least 2 billion pounds worth of shares in Lloyds next spring and return the bank to full private ownership.\n(Reporting By Sinead Cruise, editing by Steve Slater)\nNext In Business News\n",

Our primary focus, as always, remains serving our clients' needs.\"\nBarclays Chief Executive Jes Staley said the outcome of the vote would not affect the bank's new strategy of being a 'transatlantic' bank anchored in the UK and US. \"The strategy we announced on 1 March, 2016 was not conditional on the UK remaining in the EU.\"\nDouglas Flint, Chairman of HSBC, Europe's largest lender, said Friday marked \"a new era for Britain and British business.\"\n\"The work to establish fresh terms of trade with our European and global partners will be complex and time consuming. We will be working tirelessly in the coming weeks and months to help our customers adjust to and prepare for the new environment.\"\nBritain's 2.2 million financial industry workers face years of uncertainty and the risk of thousands of job cuts after the country voted to quit the European Union, leaving question marks over London's status as Europe's premier financial centre.\n(Reporting By Anjuli Davies and Lawrence White, editing by Sinead Cruise)\nNext In Funds News\n",

He said in March he was aiming to wipe out Britain's budget deficit by 2018/19.\nBritain sold a 60 percent stake in Royal Mail in 2013, attracting criticism at the time from rival politicians and trade unions who said the firm had been sold off too cheaply after shares rose by as much as 87 percent following the sale.\nOsborne appeared to acknowledge those concerns as he made his announcement in parliament. \"We will only sell our stake when we can be sure we are getting value for money,\" he said.\nThe shares were down 3 percent on the news on Thursday.\nNo decision has yet been taken on whether the shares would be sold privately to investors or to the public, a Treasury official said.\nThe sale of further Royal Mail shares will begin this year, the finance ministry added.\nIt also said the extra savings found by government departments included a plan to sell land around London's Kings Cross station which was valued at around 345 million pounds.

The news sent shares in the company 2.7% lower to £12.65.\nThe drop came as fund sales across the investment market collapsed , with this year's ISA season, the period from the beginning of March to the end of the tax year, registering the lowest level of fund sales since records began.\nHargreaves Lansdown chief executive Ian Gorham said fears over the referendum on the UK's European Union membership was holding back investment.\n'Hargreaves Lansdown continues to maintain its market leading position as the most popular destination for UK retail investors, with strong new business and client growth for the period notwithstanding a challenging ISA season for the industry in the context of volatile market conditions, low investor confidence and 25% of investors quoting current uncertainty over EU membership as reducing their propensity to invest.'\nAssets held by the stockbroker rose to £60.3 billion from £58.8 billion over the four months, with revenues in the 10 months to the end of April hitting £268.9 million, up 12% on the same period last year.\nAnalysts judged the results sound given the backdrop. 'Hargreaves delivered robust flows despite a challenging backdrop' said Portia Patel at RBC Capital Markets.\nPaul McGinnis at Shore Capital said it was a 'solid' update 'following a relatively muted ISA season for the industry as a whole (no doubt the plunging equity markets in the first six weeks of the year weren't massively helpful)'.\n",

  "articleText" : "Cuts to take place in retail banking and technology operations\nBank is creating about 115 new roles as part of the changes\nShare on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp\nLloyds Banking Group Plc, Britain’s largest mortgage lender, will eliminate about 640 jobs and close 23 branches as part of a cost-cutting program that started in October 2014, according to a labor union.\nThe cuts are part of the plan to pare about 9,000 roles by 2017, the Accord labor union, which represents the bank’s employees, said in an e-mailed statement. The job losses, which take cuts under the program to about 7,300 so far, are in divisions such as consumer banking, retail wealth management and technology operations, with the bank seeking to redeploy some people in other positions. The bank is creating about 115 new jobs as part of the changes.\n“We expect to continue to have the biggest branch network in the U.K.,” Lloyds said in an e-mailed statement confirming the reductions. “The group’s policy is always to use natural turnover and to redeploy people wherever possible to retain their expertise and knowledge within the group.”\nChief Executive Officer Antonio Horta-Osorio is facing a bigger challenge to boost dividend payments after Britain voted to leave the European Union on Thursday, tipping the country toward a potential recession and policy easing from the Bank of England. With almost all of its assets in Britain, Lloyds may be harder hit than other U.K. banks with global operations like HSBC Holdings Plc, analysts have said.\nThe internal announcement of the job cuts and branch closures comes a day after the CEO wrote to reassure staff following the outcome of the referendum, and bought 100,000 Lloyds shares after the stock plunged by 25 percent in two days. He said the bank’s strategy “remains unchanged” and that the “fundamentals of the group are strong,” according to a memo obtained by Bloomberg News.\n“We will work to ensure that employees are treated with the dignity and respect that they are entitled to expect at this worrying time,” Ged Nichols, general secretary of the Accord labor union, said in a statement. “We’ll do everything we can to assist them.”\nLloyds is considering deeper cuts beyond the 2014-2017 plan, and could complete the current program ahead of schedule, two people with knowledge of the matter said in April. The bank and other major lenders are pushing to reduce costs as rising competition for loans and record-low interest rates erode earnings.\nThe U.K. government still owns a 9.1 percent stake in the bank after spending 20.5 billion pounds ($27.5 billion) rescuing it during the financial crisis.\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

REUTERS/Phil Noble\nBy Esha Vaish\nBritain's Royal Mail Plc warned on Thursday it faced slightly higher than previously expected costs to modernise its operations in what it said was an extremely competitive domestic postal and parcel market.\nRoyal Mail's prospects hinge on its ability to cut costs and modernise operations to gain a larger share of the parcels market in light of declining letter volumes.\n\"It's an intensely competitive time in the UK and I don't see that letting up anytime soon and I see the trends in that regards to be broadly the same this year as they were last year,\" Chief Executive Moya Greene told Reuters.\nIt has also been hurt by the loss of some business from key customer Amazon, which recently started its own delivery network. Other competitors such as UK Mail have added extra capacity, threatening Royal Mail's dominance at home.\nThe 500-year-old company, whose red post boxes decorated with the Royal Crest are a feature of landscapes across the UK,  forecast costs associated with the transformation of its UK business of around 160 million pounds for the current financial year.\nIt previously forecast 120 million pounds to 140 million pounds per year until 2018.\nIts shares fell as much as 5.8 percent and were down 3.8 percent at 488.8 pence by 1040 GMT, underperforming London's blue chip FTSE 100 index.\nIts shares have gained around 14 percent since the beginning of the year.\nAnalysts also pointed to uncertainties over the outcome of a review of the company by regulator Ofcom, which is looking into whether Royal Mail breached competition law, and negotiation talks over wages and its pension scheme.\nLiberum analyst Gerald Khoo wrote the higher costs could drag down Royal Mail's results for the year ending March 2017.\nHelped by tight cost control, Royal Mail's adjusted operating profit before transformational costs rose 5 percent to 742 million in the year ended March 27. Analysts on average had expected 727 million pounds, according to a company-compiled consensus.\nIncluding pensions accounting and other one-off items, however, profit fell 2 percent.\n(Reporting by Esha Vaish in Bengaluru; Editing by Anupama Dwivedi and Susan Thomas)\nNext In Business News\n",

Last year the bank paid out 2.4 billion pounds, an 11 percent jump from 2012.\nBanker bonuses are a political issue in the U.K. after the nation’s financial system was propped up by about 1 trillion pounds in 2008 and 2009 of capital and government guarantees. The government, which owns stakes in Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and Lloyds Banking Group Plc, faces a general election on May 7. Barclays Plc Chairman David Walker defended the bank’s remuneration policy after a shareholder revolt last year, arguing limiting investment bankers’ pay meant the bank would struggle to attract and retain “high-quality people.”\nA spokesman for Barclays declined to comment on the bonus pool. Sky News reported the awards earlier Thursday.\nBarclays on March 3 is expected to post a 6 percent increase in full-year pretax profit to 5.5 billion pounds from the year earlier, according to the average estimate of 16 analysts. The shares have risen 6.9 percent this year, the best performance among major U.K. banks.\nLloyds, RBS\nLloyds and RBS, which announce annual earnings next week, also plan to shrink their bonus pools, Sky News said. Lloyds will cut payouts to about 375 million pounds compared with 395 million in 2013, and RBS plans to award about 500 million pounds, it said.\nOfficials at RBS and Lloyds declined to comment.\nU.K. Financial Investments Ltd., which manages the government’s stakes in nationalized lenders, discussed bonuses at a board meeting this week, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. A spokesman for UKFI declined to comment.\nLondon-based Barclays is eliminating 7,000 jobs at its investment bank and selling businesses with low returns as it attempts to reduce costs, boost capital and transform the ethical culture of the firm.\nBarclays is planning to raise total pay for some junior bankers by 20 percent to 40 percent as the bank seeks to retain talent, two people with knowledge of the matter said this month. Mid-level employees have objected to the decision, concerned about the shrinking compensation gap with their juniors, the people said.

Diageo noted a statement by USL, in which it holds a 54.78% majority stake, saying that the board had lost confidence in Vijay Mallya and had called on him to resign. Mallya had indicated he wouldn't tender his resignation, said USL, which had said it would ask shareholders to vote him out if he refused to step down.

A deal could revive the old Midland Bank, which was bought by the lender in 1992. The move comes amid government requirements that banks separate their retail business from the rest of their operations as of 2019.

British officials told the FT that Downing Street would be \"sceptical\" about any takeover as it wants the UK to retain two big global oil companies.

Although exploration and new exploitation in the disputed area is suspended, existing developments such as the TEN project can continue to be developed.

The company said its revenue for the first quarter of 2015 was EUR134.9 million, up from EUR102.7 million a year before, and up from EUR126.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2014.

In a statement, the bank said its results were hurt by litigation expenses of EUR1.5 billion, mainly reflecting a settlement with the US and UK authorities relating to interbank offered rates and bank levy charges of EUR561 million.

  "articleText" : "Market News | Wed Oct 7, 2015 | 2:08pm EDT\nUPDATE 5-SABMiller rejects AB InBev's $104 bln takeover approach\n* AB InBev proposes cash offer and partial share alternative\n* SABMiller says it \"very substantially\" undervalues it\n* African markets seen as key attraction to AB InBev\n* Top shareholder Altria supports offer, No. 2 does not   (Adds comments by AB InBev CEO)\nBy Philip Blenkinsop and Martinne Geller\nBRUSSELS/LONDON, Oct 7 SABMiller, the world's second largest brewer, has promptly rejected an improved takeover proposal from Anheuser-Busch InBev, saying its 68 billion-pound ($104 billion) valuation was \"very substantially\" under par.\nRefusal of the offer, made public on Wednesday after earlier proposals were refused privately, opens the door to a week of intense wrangling before an Oct. 14 deadline for a formal bid set by the UK takeover panel.\nThe deal would be one of the biggest in corporate history, uniting the maker of Budweiser, Corona and Stella Artois beers with that of Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell. The combined entity would make nearly a third of the world's beer.\nAB InBev realistically needs access to SAB's private financial data if it is to make an informed formal bid, but said that so far the board had not engaged meaningfully.\nA deadline extension can be granted if SABMiller asks for it, and AB InBev wants shareholders to lobby the company.\n\"The deadline is approaching and we thought we should make it public,\" AB InBev CEO Carlos Brito said on a conference call. \"Now it's up to the shareholders to have a look at it. If they think this is a good offer, they should act and encourage the board to engage.\"\nBrito said he was committed to a friendly deal, but did not rule out going hostile.\n\"I don't want to go there now. I think there's too much to be gained in the next few days,\" he said.\nSHAREHOLDER RESPONSE\nBelgium-based AB InBev went public with its offer of 42.15 pounds in cash per SABMiller share, after the board rejected two prior approaches, at 38 and 40 pounds. The offer includes a discounted cash-and-share alternative designed only for SAB's two largest shareholders, Altria Group and BevCo.\nThe discount aims to satisfy their desire to avoid huge taxes on cash gains and ensure all other shareholders accept cash, which would be financed with the help of a $70 billion debt package being lined up.\nAltria, the tobacco group which has 26.6 percent of SABMiller, said it supported the bid and would be prepared to opt for the share alternative.\nAB InBev said it lacked the support of BevCo, controlled by the Santo Domingo family of Colombia. Representatives for BevCo, which owns about 13 percent of SABMiller, could not be reached by Reuters. BevCo has two seats on the SABMiller board.\nSABMiller said its board, excluding the three members nominated by Altria, unanimously rejected the proposal.\n\"It still very substantially undervalues SABMiller, its unique and unmatched footprint, and its standalone prospects,\" the UK-based company said in a statement.\nSABMiller Chairman Jan du Plessis called his company \"the crown jewel of the global brewing industry\" and said AB InBev's proposals were designed to be unattractive to many shareholders.\nLawyers not involved in the deal interpreted SAB's language as implying that it could want as much as 10 percent more than the proposed price, which amounts to a 44 percent premium to SAB's share price before news of AB InBev's approach was made public on Sept. 16.\nAB InBev's CEO called the price \"full\" and said SAB's board was \"over-optimistic\" about its standalone prospects, saying the company would need an almost 50 percent jump in operating earnings in U.S. dollars to make up the value he is offering and that that would likely not happen for at least three or four years.\nThe cash-and-share alternative, which is technically open to all shareholders, would give them 2.37 pounds per share plus 0.48 special unlisted AB InBev shares that are convertible into ordinary stock after a five-year lock-up period.\nGiven that AB InBev intends to use this instrument to acquire the stakes of Altria and BevCo, which together own about 41 percent of the company, SABMiller said the implied price tag was only 40.21 pounds per share, or 65 billion pounds ($99.53 billion).\nRBC Capital Markets analysts said the proposal appeared some way below a \"knock-out\" bid, and Bernstein Securities said a higher bid, and acceptance, was the most likely outcome.\nSABMiller shares closed up 0.3 percent at 37.24 pounds, while AB InBev closed up 0.6 percent in Brussels at 98.65 euros.\nAFRICA THE PRIZE\nAnalysts have long seen this deal as the likely end-game for decades of industry consolidation, as the big four - AB InBev, SABMiller, Heineken and Carlsberg already brew over half the world's beer.\nIt would add Africa and certain Latin American and Asian breweries to AB InBev's presence across the Americas.\n\"We believe Africa in particular will be a key driver for the joint company in the future,\" Brito said.\nAB InBev also said it planned to establish a secondary share listing and regional headquarters in Johannesburg, where SABMiller has a secondary listing, which local investors have said they want retained.\nPublic Investment Corp, a South African state-owned firm with a 3.4 percent stake in SABMiller, said the listing addressed one of its concerns and that it would wait for guidance from SABMiller's board.\nAB InBev, partly controlled by 3G Capital, a private equity fund run by a group of Brazilian investors, has a strong track record for takeovers, followed by keen cost-cutting, but Brito declined to say what potential synergies a SABMiller deal might realise.

REUTERS/Toby Melville\nHOUSTON/LONDON BP Plc (BP.L) will face a maximum fine of $13.7 billion under the Clean Water Act for its Gulf of Mexico oil spill, several billion dollars less than feared, after a judge ruled that it was smaller than the U.S. government claimed.\nThe ruling by federal magistrate Carl Barbier put the size of the worst offshore spill in U.S. history in 2010 at 3.19 million barrels.\nThat was well below the government's estimate of 4.09 million barrels, which could have led to penalties of up to $17.6 billion.\nBP's stock rose 2.4 percent in London by 0920 GMT on Friday, outperforming the broader energy index .SXEP, as investors worried about the size of potential penalties breathed a sigh of relief.\n\"The ruling is a step in the right direction of what appears set to be a long and hard-fought legal battle,\" Barclays said in a research note.\nUnder a \"gross negligence\" ruling Barbier issued in September, BP could be fined a statutory limit of up to $4,300 for each barrel spilled, though he has authority to assign lower penalties.\nA simple \"negligence\" ruling, which BP sought, caps the maximum fine at $1,100 per barrel.\nThe Clean Water Act penalties would come on top of more than $42 billion the oil major has set aside or spent for clean-up, compensation and fines. About 810,000 barrels were collected during clean-up.\nIn his ruling on Thursday, Barbier said BP's response to the disaster was not grossly negligent, but stuck to his earlier opinion that it had been grossly negligent leading up to the Macondo well blowout.\nPenalties will be assigned after the third and final phase of the company's non-jury trial, which starts on Tuesday in New Orleans. BP lawyers are expected to argue for a small fine per barrel.\n\"BP believes that considering all the statutory penalty factors together weighs in favor of a penalty at the lower end of the statutory range,\" a BP spokesman said.\nThe first two phases of the trial, over the degree of negligence and the size of the spill, have concluded.\nEven after the Clean Water Act fines are set, BP may face other bills from a lengthy Natural Resources Damage Assessment -- which could require BP to carry out or fund environmental restoration work in the Gulf -- as well as other claims.\n(Reporting By Jonathan Stempel, additional reporting by Dmitry Zhdannikov in London,; Writing by Terry Wade; Editing by Bernard Orr and Keith Weir)\nNext In Business News\n",

Our respective pipelines afford multiple targeted options to create innovative combinations in immuno-oncology and beyond, that we hope will lead to future cancer treatment options.”\nEarlier this year, Lilly and AstraZeneca announced a Phase I clinical trial collaboration to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of combining durvalumab and ramucirumab as a treatment for patients with advanced solid tumours.\nIn addition to combinations within the company’s own pipeline of immuno-oncology and small molecule investigational medicines, AstraZeneca and its biologics research and development arm, MedImmune, have a broad programme of combination clinical trials underway with a range of partners.\nNOTES TO EDITORS\nAbout AstraZeneca in Oncology\nOncology is a therapeutic area in which AstraZeneca has deep-rooted heritage.

  "articleText" : "Barclays Said to Cut 150 at Investment Bank; McCormick Exits\nJulia Verlaine and Stephen Morris\nJuly 31, 2015 — 6:59 AM EDT\nUpdated on\nShare on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp\nBarclays Plc is cutting 150 employees, including managing directors, at its investment bank globally as the firm shrinks its fixed-income operations, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.\nJim McCormick, the London-based global head of asset allocation research, and Sharon Casey, a managing director for interest rate sales in New York, were among the departures, said the person, who asked not to be identified because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly.\nBarclays, which is losing its grip on Europe’s fixed-income market to U.S. competitors, is trimming those operations as regulation makes trading debt less lucrative. Even with the bank’s macro group, which includes currencies and interest-rate sales and trading, posting a 10 percent increase in revenue in the second quarter, Chairman John McFarlane plans to focus on debt and equity capital markets businesses.\nJames White, a London-based spokesman for Barclays, declined to comment. McCormick declined to comment. E-mails to Casey weren’t immediately returned. Casey had been with the bank for more than a decade, while McCormick joined from hedge fund Comac Capital in 2013.\nThe cuts are part of former Chief Executive Officer Antony Jenkins’s plan to cut 7,000 jobs at the investment bank by 2016, with reductions mostly taking place at the director and managing director level, the person said. The securities units employed 20,500 globally as of the end of 2014.\nNew Hires\nSo far, the revamp of the investment bank has helped boost the shares. Barclays has risen 18 percent this year, making it the top-performing major U.K. bank stock. The lender reported a 8.8 percent increase in profit in the second quarter, driven by its investment bank, which had a 35 percent jump in earnings.\nJonathan Fischer, who worked in European credit sales in London, also left the bank as part of the cuts, said two different people with knowledge of his departure. Fischer didn’t immediately respond to calls and emails.\nWhile fixed income is being cut back, Barclays has bolstered its advisory and debt arm, making senior hires in areas where it anticipates a competitive advantage.\nThe bank added Barry Meyers from JPMorgan Chase & Co. as head of the U.K. equity capital markets team. He started this month as a director, a rank above his title at JPMorgan. Barclays also hired Philip Shelley in February from Goldman Sachs Group Inc., where he was co-head of U.K. corporate broking.\nBarclays has added at least eight managing directors in the U.S. so far this year, with three of those in telecommunications, media and technology, including Peter Cohen, hired from Blackstone Group LP to run media banking.\nThe British lender also cut employees from its European asset-backed securities unit in London this week, according to three people familiar with the matter. Chris Carnell, head of European ABS sales, and Stuart Calnan, head of European ABS trading are no longer with the bank.\nJob Cuts Part of Major Reforms at Barclays\nRead this next:\n",

REUTERS/Michael Buholzer/Files\nBy Olivia Kumwenda-Mtambo and Lionel Laurent | JOHANNESBURG/LONDON\nJOHANNESBURG/LONDON Glencore said on Tuesday it was strong enough to ride out current volatility in commodity markets, helping to lift the mining group's shares by a fifth.\nGlencore's stock rebounded after a fall of 30 percent to a record low on Monday in response to uncertainty over its ability to cope with a prolonged fall in global metal prices.\nIts shares closed up 16.9 percent at 84.91 pence in London.\nThe Swiss-based company said its business remained operationally and financially robust and it was confident in the medium and long-term fundamentals of its commodities, which include copper and coal.\n\"We have positive cash flow, good liquidity and absolutely no solvency issues,\" a company spokesman said in a statement.\n\"Glencore has no debt covenants and continues to retain strong lines of credit and secure access to funding.\"\nLenders said on Tuesday they remain supportive of the embattled commodities trader and mining company, which has around $13 billion of liquidity available and can finance its debt maturities for two years.\n\"We are watching quite carefully, but without the concern or type of hysteria you are seeing in equities,\" a head of loan syndicate at a bank said. \"If the company is left to resolve its own issues, we are quite confident that they will do so.\"\nThe shares had plunged on Monday wiping about 3.5 billion pounds from Glencore's market value on fears the group was not doing enough to cut its $30 billion debt pile as commodity prices tumbled.\nChief Executive Ivan Glasenberg had to bow to shareholder pressure this month by agreeing to cut Glencore's debts and protect its credit rating after the prices of its main products fell.\nGlencore plans to suspend dividends, sell assets, cut copper production and raise cash, among other measures, to cut its net debt by a third by the end of 2016. The group has already raised $2.5 billion through a share placement.\nOn Tuesday, Chile's second-biggest copper mine Collahuasi, which is owned by Glencore and Anglo American, announced plans to cut output by 300,000 tonnes per year to protect against sinking copper prices.\nGlencore's $10 billion share listing in London in 2011 turned its managers into billionaires. Now there is speculation it might make sense for Glencore management to take the company private.\nAnalysts at Citi have said Glencore should consider going private via a management buyout. Such a move would make it easier to restructure while metals prices are slumping and could allow various assets to be spun off.\n\"In the event the equity market continues to express its unwillingness to value the business fairly, the company management should take the company private, whereby restructuring measures can be taken easily and quickly,\" Citi analysts wrote in a note to clients.\nBut mining industry bankers said it would be virtually impossible for management to put together the required financing for any buyout.\n\"How, in a market where everyone thinks it has too much leverage, would you put leverage on it?\" one senior banker said.\nInstead, the company is expected to step up its divestment plans beyond those already announced earlier this month, one banking source said, adding that while other options like a company split or a buyout of the trading business were possible, they were unlikely.\nThree Glencore executives are among the firm's top ten shareholders, including Glasenberg with an 8.42 percent stake, according to Thomson Reuters data. Just two weeks ago, management took up 22 percent of the new shares being issued at 125 pence each. The stock has fallen more than a third since then.\nGlencore has been holding talks with talks with investor trade body Investment Association related to its $2.5 billion equity placing, Sky News reported.\nSome investors, including the Investment Association, have  criticized the way in which Glencore raised the money, saying that the mining company had breached shareholder protection principles.\nA spokesman for Investment Association confirmed to Reuters that the trade body was in talks with Glencore, but did not divulge any further details. Glencore declined to comment.\n(Additional reporting by Freya Berry in London.; Writing by Jane Merriman.

Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian\nFriday 14 October 2016 11.47 BST\nLast modified on Friday 14 October 2016 22.01 BST\nClose\nThis article is 1 month old\nThe risk of electricity blackouts in Britain this winter has diminished, after the National Grid and the government spent more than £140m on tools designed to guarantee the lights stay on.\nThe Grid’s capacity margin, the cushion between electricity demand and supply, has risen to 6.6%, beating its summer prediction of 5.5%. The buffer zone is also well ahead of last year’s “tight but manageable” 5.1%, which was the lowest in a decade .\nIn its annual winter outlook, the firm that operates the UK’s electricity transmission network said it expects average peak demand of 52.7GW during cold weather, with 55GW of supply capacity available.\nThe improved position is partly down to a reprieve for the Eggborough coal power plant in North Yorkshire, which was due to shut down before the winter but will stay partly operational until March 2017.\nThe margin was also boosted by a breakdown in the UK’s electricity interconnector with Ireland, which usually results in more electricity flowing out than in.\n“Since publishing the provisional winter margin in July, additional electricity generation has been made available to the market,” said Phil Sheppard, the Grid’s director of system operations. “This has had a positive impact on the outlook for winter, increasing the margin between potential supply and demand.”\nWhile the extra availability of power from Eggborough made blackouts less likely, the Grid also bought tools designed to ensure the lights won’t go out. The UK’s electricity system operator spent £122m on supplemental balancing reserve contracts, which pay power plants to be on standby in case of outages elsewhere or a sudden surge in demand.\nNational Grid: two coal plants to get £77m to be on winter standby\nRead more\nThese included £77m of payments to the Eggborough and Fiddler’s Ferry power plants and will add about £1.80 to the average annual bill.\nThe Grid said it expected to have to activate these contracts at some point this winter, meaning the plants would be put on standby and could be asked to generate electricity. This is most likely to happen during the week beginning 9 January, when the weather is likely to be cold and several power plants have planned outages scheduled.\nThe government has also spent about £22m on 0.8GW demand-side response contracts, where firms agree to reduce or shift their power usage, according to an estimate from the Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) thinktank.\nWithout these measures, the Grid said the capacity margin would have been just 1.1%. “The increased cushion between supply and demand in this year’s winter outlook shows that power cuts are exceedingly unlikely,” said Dr Jonathan Marshall, energy analyst at the ECIU.\n“A boost on last year – when there were no issues in the system – shows that the UK continues to have a reliable electricity system as we go through this period of transition.While the costs are slightly higher this year, they account for just 0.3% of the average electricity bill, an unavoidable cost as the UK faces up to the task of replacing huge amounts of ageing infrastructure over the next decade.”\nThis winter is the last before reform of the electricity market ushers in a completely different system of power supply designed to render such tools unnecessary.\nBritain will also be “well supplied” with gas for heating, the Grid said.\n",

REUTERS/Christian Hartmann\nBy Sarah Young | AMSTERDAM\nAMSTERDAM The disaster at budget airline Germanwings which killed 150 people will not harm the image of low-cost air travel in Europe, easyJet (EZJ.L) chief executive Carolyn McCall said on Tuesday.\nAirlines across the world were left reeling after investigators said they believed the co-pilot of a Germanwings flight locked himself alone in the cockpit and deliberately steered it into a mountain, killing everyone on board.\nGermanwings, founded in 2002 as a budget carrier, was acquired by full-service airline Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) in 2009, and the parent company has expanded it into its main short-haul operator to battle competition from low-cost carriers such as  easyJet and Ryanair (RYA.I).\nMcCall, in Amsterdam to open a new base for the airline, said the Germanwings crash was a matter for all airlines.\n\"This is not a budget airline issue. This is an airline issue. This is an industry thing,\" she told Reuters in an interview.\nEasyJet moved swiftly to change its cockpit policy as details emerged of what had caused the crash, requiring two crew members to be on the flightdeck at all times.\nUnder European regulations, pilots were permitted to leave the cockpit temporarily at certain times and under certain circumstances, leaving the other pilot alone. Since the crash, the EU has advised airlines to have two crew members on the flightdeck at all times.\n\"I think that every airline will be looking at everything they do in light of what's happened,\" McCall said.\nAfter German prosecutors said Lubitz had hidden an illness from his employers, strict German laws on doctor-patient confidentiality have come under the spotlight.\nAny changes to a pilot's right to medical confidentiality would be an issue not just for the airline industry, but on a wider scale, McCall said.\n\"That's an ethics issue. It's something that the government will have to address. If they don't do it in the Army, the Navy, there are equally sensitive areas that have the same levels of confidentiality. It would be a much bigger deal than just an airline thing.\"\nEasyJet, she added, has for years done more than is required by legislation to ensure the well-being of its pilots through its fatigue-reporting management system, which is used to keep a check on pilot tiredness.\nBudget airlines have a reputation for pushing for the lowest pilot pay and the most flexible working arrangements to keep a lid on costs.\nEasyJet, unlike some other carriers, said it employs staff directly on permanent contracts and aims to pay a median salary for the country where staff members are based, plus performance and company-related bonuses which can take pay higher.\nBut for McCall safety is about culture, not wages.\n\"I don't think safety has anything to do with pay,\" she said. \"No one doubts that safety is the number one priority of the airline. I think that's embedded in our culture.\"\n\"Safety is entirely to do with the culture of an airline, with the professionalism of people that you employ, and that comes down to new recruits, how you recruit how you treat people and how the safety culture permeates the airline,\" she said.\n(Reporting by Sarah Young; Editing by Angus MacSwan)\nNext In Aerospace & Defense\n",

But they also specified that the amounts were subject to change.\nNone of the banks responded immediately when contacted by AFP.\nSome of the banks in Thursday's announcement had already agreed to specific sums.\nUS banking giant JPMorgan Chase agreed to pay $99.5 million in January, followed by Bank of America at $180 million, Citigroup at $394 million and Swiss UBS at $135 million.\n\"In addition to the billions of dollars in compensation, these settling banks have agreed to cooperate with investors in their continuing litigation\" against other institutions, Hausfeld said.\nThursday's agreements are distinct from proceedings led by US and British regulators, which in May ordered $6 billion in fines on six major banks -- Barclays, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Royal Bank of Scotland, UBS and Bank of America -- for rigging foreign exchange market and Libor interest rates.\nBarclays, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and the Royal Bank of Scotland all pleaded guilty to US Justice Department charges of conspiring to manipulate the massive currency market.\n\"While the recoveries here are tremendous, they are just the beginning,\" said Hausfeld chairman Michael Hausfeld.\n\"Investors around the world should take note of the significant recoveries secured in the United States and recognize that these settlements cover a fraction of the world's largest financial market,\" he said.\nThe firm also noted that it was considering \"concerted action\" in London .\nStay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!\nFROM AROUND THE WEB\n",

One is, today we are one of the largest movers of money -up to $1 trillion or more on a daily basis -because we're the only bank that ac tually operates in 100 coun tries. So, there is obviously an opportunity around our own general ledgers,\" said Aditya Menon, managing director of global digital strategy at Citigroup.\nMenon further said: \"We like the idea of a cryptocur rency that doesn't have vol atility. We are experiment ing with the idea of a fiat-backed digital curren cy -backed by a pound or a dollar or euro as the case may be. So, there is some in terest there.\"\nThe company's bet on blockchain comes at a time when the traditional bank ing and financial services industry is facing rapid disruption from the rise of new-age payments banks, mobile wallets and cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.\n\"For us it's not so much about bitcoin because bitcoin is something that has very volatile value, questionable in terms of an entry in and entry out from a regulatory perspective. But if you think about the distributed ledger -that is extremely valuable,\" said Menon, who also heads application programme interface development at Citigroup. Traditional banks like Citi and JP Morgan are scrambling to play catch-up with new-age fintech companies that are starting to leverage blockchain technology .\nAccording to a July report from the International Business Times, Citigroup has built its own digital currency based on bitcoin and the blockchain called CitiCoin.\nExperts see blockchain technology as hugely disruptive since it completely overhauls the traditional methods of transacting and maintaining online records, and allows banks and people to directly exchange money without having to rely on the additional, more expensive layers of middlemen.\n\"Blockchain gives you the ability to not only update a distributed ledger but settle it, which otherwise is a laborious process especially if you're doing it across multiple countries and times zones, etc. So there is one opportunity there,\" said Menon. He said trade finance is another area, citing the example of open-account trading.\"There is a last-mile hostage situation where money , documents need to change hands. So, if you use a distributed ledger to actually record ownership of title of the goods and then that changes hands based on the payments -that's a great example of how you can use blockchain technology to facilitate a trade transaction, which otherwise has been done in a very manual-intense way,\" he said.\nAt the company's research and development labs in Dublin, a team of researchers and executives are currently experimenting with the use of blockchain in traditional financial services.\nA number of regulators have also started looking at blockchain as a viable alternate way to run real-time payments and settlements, said Menon.\nStay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!\nDON'T MISSany stories, follow us on Twitter Follow\nFROM AROUND THE WEB\n",

But he warned in September it would be a \"long journey\".\nLike its rivals Morrisons is engaged in a price war to stem the loss of shoppers to discounters Aldi [ALDIEI.UL] and Lidl [LIDUK.UL] and is also grappling with commodity-driven price deflation that shows little sign of abating.\nPrior to Tuesday's update analysts were on average forecasting 306 million pounds, versus 345 million made in 2014-15.\nThe firm said it was entering into consultation to close a further seven supermarkets.\n($1 = 0.6885 pounds)\n(Reporting by James Davey and Paul Sandle; editing by Kate Holton)\nNext In Business News\n",

This is a hefty premium of around 52 percent to the 90-day trading average for BG, setting the bar high for any potential counter-bid by a company such as Exxon, which has said it would also use the downturn in oil markets to expand.\nThe third-biggest oil and gas deal ever by enterprise value will bring Shell assets in Brazil, East Africa, Australia, Kazakhstan and Egypt. BG has some of the world's most ambitious projects in liquefied natural gas (LNG), where demand is growing as consumers turn away from more polluting fuels such as coal.\nShell is already the world's leading LNG company and it would get BG's capacity in LNG logistics - complex infrastructure that includes terminals, pipelines, specialised tankers, rigs, super coolers, regasification facilities and storage points.\n\"We are seeing a gasification of energy demand. Shell clearly recognise this,\" said Richard Gorry, director at JBC Energy Asia. \"That said, Shell is still taking a big gamble because if the price of oil and gas doesn't go back up (in the next 24 months), I would imagine this might put them in a difficult position in terms of cash flow.\"\nBOOST TO RESERVES\nShell said on Wednesday the deal would boost its proven oil and gas reserves by 25 percent.\nStitched together by Shell CEO Ben van Beurden and BG Chairman Andrew Gould, the tie-up follows a halving of oil prices since last June, putting a premium on access to proven assets rather than costly exploration. Record low interest rates have made it easy to raise cheap funding for big deals.\n\"We have been scanning quite a few opportunities, with BG always being at the top of the list of the prospects to combine with,\" Van Beurden told a conference call. \"We have two very strong portfolios combining globally in deep water and integrated gas\".\nBritain's BG had a market capitalisation of $46 billion at Tuesday's close, Shell was worth $202 billion and Exxon, the world's largest energy company by market value, was worth $360 billion.\nBG's bonds traded up strongly on the deal and its shares closed up 27 percent at 1206 pence. Shell shares fell 5 percent to 1982.5 pence. They were the most traded stocks across Europe on Wednesday, with $1.6 billion of BG shares changing hands and $3 billion of Royal Dutch Shell shares.\nBG stock has tumbled nearly 28 percent since mid-June, when the slump in global oil prices began. The agreed price is around 20 percent above BG's share price of a year ago.\n\"In buying BG, Shell is making a bold strategic bet that oil prices will recover towards the $70-90 level in the medium term,\" said Henderson Global Investors. Brent crude was trading below $57 a barrel on Wednesday.\nBarclays bank said Shell would have to persuade its shareholders that it can control capital spending at the new company and show BG's portfolio can deliver the promised growth options beyond Brazil, \"something that, in our view, has been far from evident of late\".\nOne source close to the deal said a counterbid was unlikely. The source said a U.S. company such as Exxon may be doubly wary of getting into a takeover battle after the failure of drugmaker Pfizer's attempted takeover of AstraZeneca last year.\nThe deal represents a windfall for Shell's adviser Bank of America Merrill Lynch. BG's advisers are Goldman Sachs and the smaller Robey Warshaw.\nBAML has underwritten a 3.025-billion-pound bridge loan that will be syndicated to other banks and is expected to be taken out by a capital markets raising, according to the offer documents.\nOIL PRICE IMPACT\nWith BG, Shell would be the leading foreign oil company in Brazil. Analysts at investment bank Jefferies said they now expected Shell to surpass Exxon as the world's largest publicly traded oil and gas producer by 2018, with output of 4.2 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.\nGlobal LNG production was 246 million tonnes last year. The new Shell-BG group would have 18 percent of world output.\nVan Beurden said the presence of two large players in Australia, Brazil and China and the European Union might require a detailed conversation with anti-trust authorities, but was unlikely to lead to forced asset sales.\nThe halving in crude prices has created an environment similar to the turn of the millennium, when large mergers reshaped the industry. Back then, BP acquired rivals Amoco and Arco, Exxon bought Mobil and Chevron merged with Texaco.\n\"A deal of this size would certainly be getting everyone interested in running the ruler over potential combinations in the natural resources sector,\" said Paul Gait, an analyst at Bernstein Research.\nBut some industry watchers were reluctant to predict another flurry of mega-deals, saying many oil majors cannot afford to put stretched balance sheets under further pressure.\n\"If you're looking to the next big deal, Exxon Mobil stands out as most likely to pull the trigger,\" said Wood Mackenzie. \"But don't expect a wave of late '90s-style consolidation.\"\nShell has long been seen as a potential buyer thanks to its healthy cash flow and relatively low oil price breakeven.\nThe deal, which should generate pretax synergies of around 2.5 billion pounds per year, will result in BG shareholders owning around 19 percent of the combined group.\nLast year, BG Chairman Gould hired CEO Helge Lund from Norway's Statoil to turn around the company. Gould said on Wednesday Lund would remain the CEO through the transition.\nHowever, it was evident the deal was driven by Van Beurden, who took over as the CEO last year, and Gould, a veteran executive who previously ran oil services giant Schlumberger.\n\"I called Andrew up and we had a very good and constructive discussion about the idea and it very quickly seemed to make sense to both of us,\" Van Beurden told a conference call. \"What has happened in the last month, apart from it being a logical deal, it has also become a very compelling deal from a value perspective,\"\n(This version of the story has been refiled to fix name of Exxon Mobil)\n(Reporting by Narottam Medhora and Sai Sachin R in Bengaluru; additional reporting by Greg Roumeliotis and Denny Thomas, Henning Gloystein, Karolin Schaps, Kate Holton, Chris Mangham, Freya Berry, Silvia Antonioli and Vikram Subhedar; writing by Denny Thomas and Tom Pfeiffer; editing by Keith Weir and David Stamp)\nNext In Global Energy News\nShell CEO expects no valuation hit from climate accord\nAMSTERDAM Royal Dutch Shell  expects to pump out all the fossil fuel reserves listed on its balance sheet, its chief executive said, dismissing concerns that production limits in the wake of the Paris climate accord could hit the energy giant's valuation.\n",

Unilever plc (LON: ULVR), British American Tobacco plc (LON: BATS) and PZ Cussons plc (LON: PZC).However, Unilever continues to have significant long-term growth potential. China is forecast to increase its consumption of consumer goods at a rapid rate and this bodes well for Unilever’s top and bottom lines. Furthermore, Unilever has exposure to a wide range of markets so that if one geographic region disappoints, it has a number of others that can pick up the slack.\nBritish   American   Tobacco  is a great  stock  to own in times like these because  of   the   defensive  nature of  tobacco  companies  and   the  huge profit the company has consistently delivered for years.

Centrica  is reporting this week so that may give us some confirmation  of   the  companies change in fortunes  and   the  outlook going forward.\n© Provided by Fool Centrica, Gas ring burning\nThe EU referendum is going to have an unprecedented effect on the markets. It’s likely we’ll see increased volatility leading up to and after the vote on 23 June. These defensive shares should offer some stability to a portfolio and investors should be considering moving some capital into defensive investments.\nUtility powerhouse\nCentrica (LSE: CNA) is a classic defensive stock and should hold up well over the next few weeks. I also think the stock offers considerable scope for growth in the next few years. The company pays a chunky dividend yield of 5.5% and trades on a forward 2016 price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 12. This is below its peers and illustrates that the company is somewhat undervalued. It surprisingly raised £700m in May to make two acquisitions and pay off some debt. This was a smart move by the company and shares are now trading above the placing price. Centrica is also set to divest a number of upstream oil and gas assets in the next few years, which should lead to lower costs. These divestments could also bring cash into the business, which may lead to further dividend increases.\nJ Sainsbury plc, Next plc & British American Tobacco plc: blue-chip bargains or value traps?\nRoyston Wild considers the investment appeal of FTSE 100 (INDEXFTSE: UKX) stocks J Sainsbury plc (LON: SBRY), Next plc (LON: NXT) and British American Tobacco plc (LON: BATS).Supermarket strains\nBritish   American   Tobacco  is perhaps the epitome of a  defensive  play, returning value to shareholders through even the worst  of   the  2008-2009 financial crisis.  Consumer staple giants Reckitt Benckiser  Group  (LSE: RB),  British   American   Tobacco  (LSE: BATS) and Diageo (LSE:DGE) have each seen share sell-offs in the first weeks of 2016. These companies sell products that people  buy  in bull and bear markets alike, enjoy pricing power due to premium brands, and have proven over the decades their ability to reward…\nRoyston Wild looks at the dividend prospects of  British   American   Tobacco   plc  (LON: BATS),  Centrica   PLC  (LON: CNA) and John Wood  Group   PLC  (LON: WG).  Cigarette play  British   American   Tobacco  (LSE: BATS) cheered the market during Thursday’s session after releasing better-than-expected financial results for 2015. The London firm advised that revenues slipped 6.2% last year to £13.1bn, with adverse currency movements driving the top line lower.\nTobacco king\nIn the face of lower tobacco volumes and fewer smokers British American Tobacco (LSE: BATS) is still growing revenues and profits. Tobacco companies have always made solid defensive stocks and have outperformed the wider market since January. British American Tobacco is the biggest tobacco company in London and it trades on the highest P/E of 18.3. This looks expensive but the company has significant growth potential. E-cigarettes are becoming ever more popular and should drive revenues in the future. British American Tobacco also owns some hugely important and recognisable global cigarette brands. The company is focusing on these brands and this is boosting volumes, revenues and profits.\nSoftware giant\n3 hot recovery stocks? Centrica plc, Genel Energy plc and Sports Direct International plc\nAre these three stocks on the cusp of stunning comebacks? Centrica plc (LON: CNA), Genel Energy plc (LON: GENL) and Sports Direct International plc (LON: SPD).However, with Centrica having a sound strategy through which to turn its financial performance around, now could be a good time to buy it. That’s not to say that further share price falls can be ruled out, but rather that in the coming years it could beat the performance of the wider index.\nNational Grid  plc   and   Centrica   plc  are still great investments! Alan Oscroft | Thursday, 19 May, 2016.  3  defensive   stocks  for income: National Grid  plc , SSE  plc & Primary Health Properties  plc .  2 steady  stocks  for  the   EU   referendum : National Grid  plc   and  Dignity  plc .  Royston Wild explains why National Grid  plc  (LON: NG),  British   American   Tobacco   plc  (LON: BATS) and JD\nCentrica  was created in 1997 when  British  Gas  plc  demerged into  Centrica   plc   and  BG  plc  (later BG  Group   plc ). The demerger  grouped   British  Gas's gas supply, services, retail businesses and gas production business  of   the  Morecambe gas fields under  Centrica .  Centrica  is the largest supplier of gas to domestic customers in the UK, and one  of   the  largest suppliers of electricity, operating under the trading names \"Scottish Gas\" in Scotland and \" British  Gas\" in the rest  of   the  UK.\nSage (LSE: SGE) shares are another classic defensive play and should be much less volatile than indices in the next few weeks. The software provider has also performed well over the last six months but I’m not sure this will continue in the long term. Sage released impressive first half results in May which saw revenue up 6.2% and operating profit up 1.9%. The dividend yield has slipped to just 2% and the company is trading on a forward P/E ratio of 20 for 2017.  It has good prospects and earnings are set to grow in the future but I think the shares are well valued. Even if the company doesn’t grow rapidly it’s still defensive and should hold up during increased times of volatility.\nThese three shares may not be the best long-term investments but can be used as important ways to shelter cash during volatile times. After the EU referendum, shares should fall less on a leave vote but still rally on a remain vote. This can be a great tool for investors to use in times of uncertainty.\nCould Netsuite and Sage link up in the next big tech deal?\nSpeculation has emerged that Microsoft’s planned US26.2bn tie-up with LinkedIn could spark more tech-sector takeovers, with Sage Group plc (LON:SGE) a potential winner or loser in any deal. The next big merger could be a takeover of cloud computing specialist NetSuite Inc (NYSE:N) or Ultimate Software Group Inc. (NASDAQ:ULTI), according to a Bloomberg report. And the speculation has continued, with market gossips tipping London-listed accountancy software firm Sage to be among those eyeing Netsuite, which develops business management software systems. But they say Sage is likely to be up against big competition for the California-based firm, with other possible suitors said to include IBM (LON:IBM), Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google, Salesforce.com Inc and SAP SE (ETR:SAP). Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), which already owns 40% of NetSuite, is also thought to be watching the situation closely. Rumour has it that some of the interested parties have even approached major NetSuite shareholders, who are said to be unlikely to accept less than US&dollar;120 a share. But sector watchers reckon Sage could lose out if Oracle buys the whole of NetSuite, sells it to a rival or enters a joint venture with a new shareholder. A market source said: “If Oracle or someone else buys NetSuite, it’s not good news for Sage.” Sage said late last year that it still had much to do in its restructuring despite reporting higher revenue and subscriptions.\nShould  income-seekers pile into  Centrica   plc  (LON: CNA), BAE Systems  plc  (LON: BA) and  British   American   Tobacco   plc  (LON: BATS) right now?  However, with  British   American   Tobacco  having excellent pricing power, it has been able to increase prices and generate higher sales and profitability. Looking  ahead , there looks likely to be more  of   the  same in this regard and with the company’s Vype e-cigarettes continuing to offer long-term growth potential, the prospects for  British   American   Tobacco ’s dividend growth are very upbeat.\nThese 3  stocks  could offer much more potential than their sector peers:  British   American   Tobacco   plc  (LON: BATS),  Centrica   plc  (LON: CNA) and GKN  plc  (LON  That’s because their potential rewards may substantially outweigh their risks  and   the  resulting margin of safety could lead to stunning share price gains in the long run.

  "articleText" : "NICK GOODWAY\nWednesday 16 March 2016 08:16 BST\nStaying at home: The combined London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse group will remain listed on the FTSE 100 Yui Mok/PA\nLondon Stock Exchange has agreed its £21.6 billion merger with Deutsche Börse, saying the combination would create the largest financial exchanges business in the world, able to counter US rivals who could still try to break up their party. \nLSE chief executive Xavier Rolet, who will leave after a year bedding the merger down, said: “This is a merger of equals between two very strong businesses which will create a Europe-based premier force in global markets infrastructure.”\nHis counterpart Carsten Kengeter of Deutsche Börse, who will head the merged firm, said: “We share a strategic vision which will deliver more than the sum of the parts to our stakeholders.”\nThe companies said they had identified €450 million (£354 million) of savings through merging. \nRolet admitted this would probably mean job cuts and although he would not specify how many said they would “be balanced between London and Frankfurt”.\nKengeter responds to Libor claims\nCarsten Kengeter, chief executive of Deutsche Börse and the future head of the merged businesses, has denied any involvement in, or knowledge of, the activities of jailed Libor-rigger Tom Hayes. \nKengeter, who worked at UBS at the time of Hayes’ offences and was latterly co-head of its investment bank, said: “The allegations are false.”\nIt is understood that UBS wrote to Kengeter at the end of last year, following its internal investigation by law firm Gibson Dunn, saying that report concluded he “neither approved nor had personal awareness of the misconduct”, by Hayes.\nToday’s deal, three weeks after news of the talks first emerged, opens the door to potential rival bids from America’s ICE and CME rival exchange giants. \nRolet said he had not heard from either of them. ICE has a put or shut up deadline of March 29 to launch a rival bid. \nThe structure of the deal is unchanged with LSE shareholders ending up with 45.6% of the as yet unnamed new group and Deutsche Börse holders with 54.4%. But Rolet denied this meant the Germans would dominate.\n“The new company will be a UK plc headquartered in London and will pay tax in this country,” he said. “The biggest group of shareholders in both companies are American and British investors own 20% of Deutsche Börse while Germans only own 15%.”\nStock Exchange chairman Donald Brydon will chair the merged business with Deutsche’s Joachim Faber his deputy and Kengeter chief executive. The LSE’s David Warren will be finance director and each side will put up a further six non-executive directors.\nNick Goodway: We need LSE boss Xavier Rolet to stay in Britain\nDeutsche Börse has tried to buy the LSE twice — in 2000 and 2005 — and could still face major competition issues with the deal unlikely to be sealed until late this year or early in 2017. \nKengeter said that a vote by the UK to leave Europe would not alter the terms of the merger but that they had already set up a committee “to respond to any regulatory or legal changes needed”.\nHe said: “This combination enables Europe to maintain and enhance its position in global capital markets in the long term.” Together the two businesses had income of £3.4 billion last year against ICE’s £3.1 billion, Nasdaq’s £2.2 billion and CME’s £2.2 billion. \n“I always wanted the LSE to end up in a safe, globally relevant place,” said Rolet. “If the price of that for me was to bow out so be it.”\nMore about:\n",

Growth slowed from 4.9 percent in the fourth quarter, as the maker of Dove soaps and Axe body sprays struggled with weaker volumes and a deflationary environment that’s made it hard to raise prices.\n“What we’ve got is a very, very mixed pricing environment around the world; it’s very important to focus in these times on volume and not price,” Chief Financial Officer Graeme Pitkethly said by phone. Europe is highly competitive due to heavy discounting from rivals and prices are lower than the historical averages in Asia, he said. Pricing increased 2 percent in the quarter, below the 2.4 percent analyst estimate.\nUnilever and rivals such as Nestle SA are being hurt by deflation in Europe and North America for products such as margarines, beverages and soup mixes. To mitigate this, Chief Executive Officer Paul Polman is pushing out new, higher-margin deodorants, detergents and shampoos. He’s also\nappointed a new leader to reinvigorate the struggling spreads business, whose sales continued their multi-year decline in the quarter.\nCurrency volatility in emerging markets also hasn’t helped, as consumer spending power in countries like Brazil and South Africa has been crimped by local currencies declining against the euro. Unilever generates about 58 percent of sales from developing regions, and foreign-exchange fluctuations shaved 7.1 percent off Unilever’s revenue, which declined 2 percent to 12.5 billion euros ($14.1 billion), missing estimates.\n“Currencies continue to be the clear negative factor, having an even more negative impact than anticipated so far,” analysts at Degroof Petercam said in a note. Pitkethly said he’s started to see currencies devalue in Asia, especially in economies that are dependent on China, which is experiencing its worst economic slowdown in a quarter century.\nUnilever shares fell 0.6 percent at 11:28 a.m. in Amsterdam, and were little changed in London.

They can be cheaper to use than exchanges.\nSchneiderman's lawsuit is among the highest-profile cases as regulators probe the fairness of high-speed, automated trading practices and alternative trading systems.\nThe attorney general claimed that Barclays used its dark pool to boost revenue and bonuses, and in doing so violated the state's Martin Act, a powerful anti-fraud law.\nIn his amended complaint, Schneiderman said Barclays falsely told clients from 2012 to 2014 that its algorithms gave no advantage to particular trading venues or client orders, despite having reprogrammed those algorithms to favor the dark pool.\nHe also said Barclays \"did not police\" that pool, telling investors that 6 percent to 9 percent of trading activity was \"aggressive\" when it knew the amount was closer to 25 percent to 30 percent.\nSchneiderman also said Barclays made a false statement in an October court filing, when it indicated that it had banned a high-frequency trading firm from its dark pool in June 2012.\nThe attorney general said Barclays actually let the firm, GTS Securities LLC, trade millions of shares a day afterward.\nA GTS spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe case is Schneiderman v.

NPS is also required to track patient use under a risk evaluation and mitigation program.\n\"All of that was well known and well anticipated, so there was for us no surprises in both the label and the follow-up requirements,\" said Shire Chief Executive Officer Flemming Ornskov.\nNPS said it plans to launch sales of the drug in the second quarter of this year, but declined to comment on what the price will be. Shire's acquisition of the company is expected to close in the first quarter.\nShire, which makes Adderall and Vyvanse for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, is seeking to expand its position in the field of drugs for gastrointestinal disorders and rare diseases.\nAbout 180,000 people globally suffer from hypoparathyroidism, according to New Jersey-based NPS. In about 40 percent of cases, the condition cannot be controlled with the current treatment of high doses of calcium and vitamin D.\nThat uncontrolled population is the audience that NPS initially plans to target, which in the United States is about 20,000 patients, the company said.\nLow levels of PTH can cause tingling in the fingers and toes, muscle spasms, fatigue, muscle aches, hair loss, dry skin, headaches, mood swings and memory problems.\nNatpara is a bioengineered version of the hormone itself.\nThe condition can be caused by congenital disorders or surgery.\nData from a late-stage clinical trial of Natpara showed that 53 percent of patients treated with the drug were able to reduce their calcium and vitamin D supplements by 50 percent or more, compared with 2 percent of placebo-treated patients.\nNPS has filed for approval of Natpara in Europe.\n(Reporting by Toni Clarke in Washington; Additional reporting by Deena Beasley in Los Angeles; Editing by Leslie Adler and Andrew Hay)\nNext In Health News\n",

  "articleText" : "Royal Mail share price edges lower as group raises stamp price\nCompany introduces â€œsmallest possible increaseâ€� of one penny\nby Deyana Ivanova Friday, 19 Feb 2016, 13:49 GMT\nRoyal Mailâ€™s (LON:RMG) shares have fallen out of favour today after the British postal services group introduced a stamp price increase.\nThe FTSE 100-listed company said in a statement today that, from 29 March, the price of a first class stamp would be lifted by 1p to 64p with a similar increase meaning that  the cost of a second class stamp would rise to 55p from the current 54p. Royal Mail noted that it had â€œcarefully consideredâ€� the impact of the penny addition on customers and its own business, opting to apply the â€œsmallest possible increaseâ€�.\nâ€œWe believe these changes are necessary to help ensure the sustainability of the Universal Postal Service,â€� the company said, adding that stamp prices in the UK were among the best value in Europe. The cost of a first class stamp in the UK remained well below the European average of 78p, and below the 64p average for second class letters, Royal Mail revealed.\nStamps have more than doubled in price over the past 20 years, with rises applied both during Royal Mailâ€™s time as a state-owned company and since its privatisation in 2013. A first class stamp cost 26p in 1995, adjusted for retail price index inflation.\nBy 13:37 GMT, Royal Mailâ€™s share price had fallen 0.73 percent to 445.90p. The stock was underperforming the FTSE 100 index, which meanwhile stood 0.33 percent down at 5,952.19 points.\n",

The net proceeds of approximately £320 million, after tax and transaction costs will be used to repay borrowings.

REUTERS/Mike Hutchings\nBy Philip Blenkinsop | BRUSSELS\nBRUSSELS Anheuser-Busch InBev's CEO says a study of SABMiller's African beer markets and talks with top shareholders led to an \"alignment of stars\" that drew it to its nearest rival.\nBut observers say the real catalysts for the $100 billion takeover proposal made public on Oct. 7 are a steep fall in SABMiller's share price, search for growth beyond AB InBev's declining core Americas markets and a desire not to give SABMiller's new management enough time to execute a workable defense.\nAnalysts have speculated on the tie-up of the world's top two brewers for years. Chief Executive Carlos Brito told a conference call last week that his company has been eyeing its rival for \"quite a while\".\nIn the last few months though AB InBev has done \"deep dive\" studies of the top nine African markets, which would include SABMiller markets such as South Africa and Nigeria.\nAB InBev's larger shareholders, principally Belgian and Brazilian families, have also approached SABMiller's two main investors, cigarette-maker Altria and the BevCo company of Colombia's Santo Domingo family, which together own 40.5 percent of the UK-based brewer.\n\"Those two things were not the case a year ago, knowledge about Africa and knowledge about the intentions of those two shareholders, in terms of them being at least receptive to an approach,\" Brito said, while acknowledging that BevCo had not given its support to his proposal.\nTarget SABMiller has called the approach \"opportunistic\", timed to take advantage of a double-digit decline in its share price in July and August, depressed by weaker emerging market currencies.\n\"They saw an opportunity and they jumped on it,\" said Morningstar analyst Phil Gorham.\nLooking back, AB InBev's shares have outperformed those of its target since 2010, meaning AB InBev's market capitalization has swollen to beyond twice that of SABMiller from 1.6 times five years ago, making a purchase easier to fund.\nTROUBLE AT HOME\nWhile the share price may explain the exact timing, analysts say AB InBev's own performance woes and changes at SABMiller also played a role.\nIn just over a year, the world's second largest brewer has replaced its chairman, chief financial officer and the head of its U.S. joint venture MillerCoors. CEO Alan Clark has only been in place since April 2013, succeeding long-standing leader Graham Mackay who has since died.\n\"It's well-known that the management is not as stable as it used to be,\" said Berenberg analyst Javier Gonzalez Lastra. --\nSABMiller agreed a deal last year to combine bottling of soft drinks in Africa with Coca-Cola. Given time, industry sources say it could make its business larger or its ties more complex, making it harder for a predator to swallow.\nThe brewer tried last September to merge with Heineken but was publicly spurned in an episode that banking sources suspect helped make the company look more vulnerable.\nThere was also increased speculation among analysts and in the press about a possible tie-up between SAB and liquor giant Diageo.\nHSBC said investors should also not ignore the fundamental weakness of AB InBev's core markets of Brazil and the United States, saying the company has been driven to pursue a merger \"out of need\", rather than from a position of strength as it had in the past.\nIts U.S. volumes have declined in every year but one of the past six, with margins now slipping, while Brazil, a strong growth market for years, is now mired in recession.\nThe United States and Brazil make up just over half of AB InBev's volumes and some two-thirds of its core profit (EBITDA).\nExane BNP Paribas analyst Eamonn Ferry said AB InBev's U.S. problems were structural, with smaller craft players steadily gaining market share, while it was hard to see Brazilian consumers spending freely for the next year or two.\nSABMiller has also been hit by the weakness of local currencies, notably the South African rand and the Colombian peso, but the markets themselves have largely been growing.\nAfrica, meanwhile, is expected to see a sharp jump in the legal drinking age population in the years ahead as well as increased beer consumption among a fast-growing middle class.\nAfricans drink 9 liters of beer per head per year, compared with a global average of 45. However, alcohol consumption is in line with the global average, meaning brewers do not have to find new drinkers, but only get existing drinkers to switch to their beers.\n\"SABMiller is exposed to volatile markets, especially in Africa and less developed Latin American countries, but Africa is in that sweet spot now. If you want volume growth, it's SABMiller. It's the last frontier of beer,\" said Ferry.\n(Additional reporting by Martinne Geller; editing by Anna Willard)\nNext In Deals\n",

  "articleText" : "May 27, 2016 11:40 AM EDT\nAstraZeneca is suddenly finding out how it feels to be the underdog. \nUntil Friday, AstraZeneca looked smart for its November purchase of ZS Pharma and its potential blockbuster hyperkalemia drug ZS-9. Relypsa, which has a competing drug on the market, looked in trouble. Though its treatment for the blood condition was approved in October, it's saddled with restrictive FDA guidelines and slow sales growth. The company's high cash burn rate led it to take out $150 million in loans in April, expensively . \nAll that changed early Friday morning, when AstraZeneca announced  the FDA had rejected ZS-9. Relypsa is remembering how to enjoy life again, and AstraZeneca may be diverting scientists into time-machine research. \nIt looks like AstraZeneca may have shelled out too early and on the wrong company. Relypsa, in contrast, may be back on the blockbuster track and back to being an acquisition target. Relypsa's shares spiked as much as 27 percent Monday morning, while AstraZeneca's dropped as much as 1 percent. \nGood Morning!\nRelypsa's shares are up on the news that a rival drug to treat a blood disorder did not get approved.\nSource: Bloomberg\nIntraday times are displayed in ET.\nThe FDA declined to approve ZS-9 after finding issues in a manufacturing inspection. The agency also said it hasn't reviewed some of AstraZeneca's data on the drug. The company is working to figure out next steps and will try again for approval, but the lack of a timeline makes things unpredictable. Resolving the agency's issues and getting a new approval date may take a year or more. And the FDA could still reject the drug again based on its clinical data.\nUntil Friday, analysts expected ZS-9 to outsell Relypsa's drug Veltassa by nearly $100 million in 2020. That was based partly on expectations AstraZeneca's drug, unlike Veltassa, could be approved without a so called \"black box\" warning label -- the FDA's strictest warning -- or to treat a broader group of patients. \nVeltassa's growth has been sluggish. An average of 290 new patients per week started on the drug with a free starter supply in April, the same as in March. It's tough to tell if that's because of the black box, poor execution on Relypsa's part, or understandably slow uptake of a new rare-disease drug. \nThe bullish scenario for AstraZeneca would have put Relypsa in serious trouble; doctors likely would have preferred a freely approved ZS-9 to Veltassa, creating more acute cash worries. The company had $205 million in cash on hand as of March 31, then raised $150 million with its debt financing in May. But Relypsa has also projected spending $275 to $300 million this year. That doesn't leave much of a cushion. \nNow Relypsa has more time -- potentially a lot more time -- for its drug to gain traction in the market. With what now looks like prescient timing, Relypsa submitted new data to the FDA Wednesday that it hopes will convince the agency to lift Veltassa's black box. That could give it a much stronger competitive position. \nAbout That...\nBefore a delay to ZS-9's potential approval, consensus analyst sales estimates had the drug comfortably beating Veltassa. That may need to change.\nSource: Bloomberg\nRelypsa's woes have made it less attractive to potential acquirers. Any buyer will likely want to see some improvement in Veltassa's sales trends, or may wait for more ZS-9 clarity. But the company is far more appealing as a target than it was a day ago. \nAt the very least, AstraZeneca no longer spells certain doom for Relypsa. \nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.\nTo contact the author of this story:\nMax Nisen in New York at mnisen@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story:\nMark Gongloff at mgongloff1@bloomberg.net\nPay Stretch\nPay Stretch\nThe larger increase in average pay suggests the very top CEOs are pulling ahead of their FTSE 100 peers\nSource: High Pay Center\n",

  "articleText" : "Retail and Consumer\nAldi to open more stores than Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons combined\nAldi to outgrow Tesco by almost ten times in 2015 as pressure on 'big four' is    laid bare\nAldi first opened in the UK in 1990 and now has more than 500 stores Photo: Bloomberg\nBy Graham Ruddick\n7:30PM GMT 21 Mar 2015\nAldi is planning to open more new shops in the UK this year than Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons combined according to comprehensive new supermarket research that lays bare the dramatic changes in the industry.\nThe German discounter, which celebrates its 25th anniversary of opening in the UK this year, plans to open 1.02m sq ft of shop space in 2015, the equivalent of roughly 60 shops.\nThis compares to just 450,000 sq ft for Sainsbury’s, 220,000 sq ft for Morrisons, and is almost ten times more than the 170,000 sq ft Tesco intends to open.\nThe findings from IPD, the commercial property industry’s leading research body, and Colliers, the property agent, show how the grocery industry has been turned on its head by the rise of the discounters and a slump in sales for the “big four”, which includes Asda as well as Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons.\nThe “big four” have expanded rapidly over the last two decades but have been forced to scrap new store openings to shore up their battered balance sheets.\nRelated Articles\nSainsbury's boss claims there are 'green shoots' of recovery for supermarkets\n17 Mar 2015\nTesco announced earlier this year that it was scrapping 49 stores as new chief executive Dave Lewis responded to a fall in sales and the discovery of a £263m blackhole in retailer’s accounts. The search shows that the amount of space Tesco will open this year is down 76pc on 2014.\nIn contrast, the German discounter Aldi, which now has more than 500 shops in the UK, is ramping up its expansion plans as it grows market share. After Aldi, Marks & Spencer has the most ambitious store opening plans and intends to open 600,000 sq ft of space. Asda plans to open 550,000 sq ft while Aldi’s rival Lidl wants to open 340,000 sq ft, double the amount of Tesco.\nOverall, 3.9m sq ft of space is due to be added to Britain’s grocery industry this year. However, in a shift from recent patterns, just 29pc of this will be traditional supermarkets. Instead, 54pc will be small supermarkets of between 3,000 sq ft and 15,000 sq ft, which is Aldi’s favoured size, while 17pc will be convenience stores such as Tesco Express and Sainsbury’s Local.\nJames Watson, head of UK investment at Colliers, said the grocery industry has “rebooted itself” as the biggest chains look to fightback against a change in consumer habits towards smaller and more frequent shops rather than one weekly trip to an out-of-town supermarket.\nHe added: For all operators, it is the consumer’s increasing predilection for online delivery topped up by convenience basket shops leading to the demise of the super profits generated by the traditional trolley shop that is at the heart of their problems. Grocery delivery is not an area where the operators can make profits – yet.”\nThe report also highlights that Britain’s pension funds could take a hit from the pressure on the industry because they own supermarkets across the UK.\nIn 2014, 86pc of all the supermarkets bought were by UK institutions such as pension funds, which is in line with the historical average.\nThe value of supermarkets is now under pressure as the profitability of the industry falls and demand to develop new sites slows.\nThe value of supermarkets bought and sold in the UK dropped by 27pc year-on-year during 2014 to £1.3bn. The report said there was £500m of deals in the second quarter of the year but then the “depth of problems facing the operators became increasingly obvious”.\nMr Watson the industry was likely to become split between prime and secondary supermarkets, with stores in the busy locations still likely to perform robustly.\nHe said: “Operator difficulties are being offset by an improving economic situation and a more constrained supply of new supermarket assets.\n“However, there is now a more clearly defined primary and secondary market for assets.\n“The secondary market has more pain to come.”\n \n",

  "articleText" : "Berkshire Hathaway's 4Q profit declines 17 percent\nBy the Associated Press | February 28, 2015 | 1:36 PM EST\nOMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Berkshire Hathaway Inc. said Saturday that its fourth quarter profit slid 17 percent because of declines in the paper value of its investments and derivative contracts.\nBerkshire's quarterly profit declined to $4.16 billion, or $2,529 per Class A share, on $48.3 billion in revenue. That's down from $4.99 billion, or $3.035 per share, on $47 billion in revenue.\nThe biggest factor was investment and derivative gains of $192 million this quarter compared to $1.2 billion in 2013.\nChairman and CEO Warren Buffett has said that Berkshire's operating earnings, which exclude investments and derivatives, are a better measure of its performance. Those were $3.96 billion, or $2,412 per share, which is up from $3.78 billion, or $2,297 per share.\nThe four analysts surveyed by FactSet expected operating earnings of $2,655.09 per share, on average.\n\"I thought it was a good year, but not a great year,\" said Andy Kilpatrick, a retired stockbroker who wrote the book, \"Of Permanent Value: The Story of Warren Buffett.\"\nMost of Berkshire's 80-odd subsidiaries performed well last year with its utility and manufacturing businesses posting the biggest gains.\nBerkshire Hathaway Energy added $1.88 billion net income in 2014 after it acquired Nevada utility NV Energy, up from $1.47 billion in 2013.\nBerkshire's manufacturing, service and retail businesses added $4.5 billion to the conglomerate's profits, up from $3.9 billion. Specialty chemical manufacturer Lubrizol and toolmaker Iscar both had strong years.\nBNSF railroad struggled with service problems last year as a strong grain harvest combined with the surge in crude oil shipments clogged rail lines just as extreme cold weather took hold. BNSF still contributed nearly $3.9 billion to Berkshire's earnings, up from $3.8 billion in 2013.\nBuffett's preferred measure of Berkshire's performance is growth in book value — its assets minus liabilities. Berkshire's book value gained 8.3 percent in 2014, but trailed the S&P 500's 13.7 percent gain. Berkshire underperformed that benchmark in five of the last six years and 11 out of the past 50 years.\nBerkshire Hathaway Inc. owns roughly 80 subsidiaries, including insurance, utility, railroad, furniture and jewelry firms. The company also has major investments in Coca-Cola Co., IBM and Wells Fargo & Co.\n___\n",

REUTERS/Neil Hall\n4/4\nBy Kirstin Ridley | LONDON\nLONDON Four former Barclays (BARC.L) bankers were sentenced to between 33 months and six-and-a-half years in jail by a London judge on Thursday for conspiring to rig global benchmark interest rates.\nCalcutta-born Jay Merchant, 45, the most senior of the men to face a jury in the case, was sentenced to six-and-a-half years in the latest London Libor trial. The New York-based former derivatives trader was convicted unanimously.\nMerchant's junior, 38-year-old American Alex Pabon, was sentenced to two years and nine months and junior British Libor submitter Jonathan Mathew, 35, was handed a four-year sentence. Both men were convicted by majority verdict.\nMathew's former boss, 61-year-old former Barclays veteran Peter Johnson was also sentenced to four years. The former senior dollar Libor submitter and head dollar cash trader pleaded guilty in October 2014 and did not stand trial.\nJudge Anthony Leonard said the men had abused their position of trust, undermined the integrity of the banking industry and offended over a significant period. They will serve half their sentence in prison before being released on license.\nThey were promptly led out of the glass-enclosed dock by court officials.\nThe sentences come four years after Barclays became the first of 11 powerful banks and brokerages to be slapped with a hefty fine for their role in the rate fixing scandal, sparking a political backlash that forced out former CEO Bob Diamond, an overhaul of Libor rules and the criminal inquiry.\nHAYES MISCONDUCT \"SIGNIFICANTLY\" DIFFERENT\nThe men had faced sentences of up to 10 years after they were each charged with one count of conspiracy to defraud by plotting to rig Libor (London interbank offered rate), a benchmark for rates on around $450 trillion of financial contracts and loans, between June 2005 and September 2007.\nBut the sentences fall far short of the original 14-year jail term handed last August to Tom Hayes, a mildly autistic former UBS (UBSG.S) and Citigroup (C.N) trader, in the world's first Libor-rigging trial.\nJudge Leonard accepted that the scale of Hayes's misconduct, cast as a ringleader in a global conspiracy with staff from 10 other banks and brokerages to rig yen-denominated Libor over four years, was significantly different to the Barclays case.\nHayes' sentence was cut to 11 years on appeal and he plans a further appeal.\nTwo British former Rabobank bankers, Anthony Allen and Anthony Conti, were subsequently sentenced to two years and one year and a day in prison respectively in the first U.S. Libor trial.\nBut judge Leonard declined to take the comparative lightness of those U.S. jail terms into consideration.\n\"The sentences for each of those convicted of Libor rigging varies significantly, which indicates that the judge has taken a highly fact-sensitive approach in each case,\" said David Corker, a partner at law firm Corker Binning.\nA lawyer for Pabon declined to comment. Lawyers for the other men did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nCHEATING\nProsecutors said New York-based Merchant and Pabon were driven by greed to scheme with London-based Libor submitters, responsible for sending the bank's daily cost of borrowing estimates to a Libor administrator, to skew rates to make more money for themselves and Barclays and cheat others.\nIn an 11-week trial, the Barclays traders denied dishonesty, argued their bosses sanctioned attempts to influence rates, that they did so in full view of compliance staff and that such practices were widespread at the time.\nJohnson had pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. He  expressed contrition and said he was motivated only by a desire to be a team player and had not adjusted rates to suit his own trading book. He also denied allegations that he bullied Mathew.\nJames Hines, leading SFO counsel, has told the court traders stopped trying to influence Libor rates when the credit crisis struck in the fourth quarter of 2007 only because another form of Libor manipulation began.\nHe said there was \"little doubt\" that Johnson had been instructed to reduce Libor submissions by senior Barclays management keen to paint a rosier picture of its financial health in a practice that has become known as \"low-balling\".\nBarclays in 2012 admitted and accepted responsibility for low-balling during the credit crisis and for allowing derivatives traders to manipulate Libor rates. It paid a then-record $450 million penalty to U.S. and European authorities.\n(Reporting By Kirstin Ridley; editing by Jon Boyle and Keith Weir)\nNext In Business News\n",

REUTERS/Benoit Tessier\nBy Karolin Schaps | LONDON\nLONDON Royal Dutch Shell expects to report a near halving in profits in the last three months of 2015 following the further slide in oil prices, it said on Wednesday, a week before shareholders meet to vote on its $47 billion deal to take over rival BG Group.\nGiving preliminary estimates for results ahead of the meeting, Shell said its underlying fourth-quarter earnings on a current cost of supplies basis would be between $1.6-1.9 billion, down from $3.26 billion a year ago.\nOil prices fell by another 24 percent in the fourth quarter, as global supplies continued to outstrip demand, further eroding oil companies' upstream revenues.\nHowever, BG, which also provided a short trading update on Wednesday ahead of its own shareholder meeting on the takeover deal next week, positively surprised investors by beating its 2015 production target.\n\"We believe the in-line performance of both companies should be viewed positively prior to the Shell shareholder vote,\" said analysts at BMO Capital Markets, who rate Shell shares as 'underperform'.\nThe companies aim to have cut a combined 10,000 staff and contractor jobs by the end of this year and Shell said on Wednesday it could further cut combined capital investments below the $33 billion targeted for 2016.\nShell shareholders are set to cast their votes on the deal on Jan. 27, followed by BG investors the next day, the final hurdles to be cleared for the deal to proceed, one of the biggest energy sector acquisitions in the past decade.\nNorway's $790 billion sovereign wealth fund, which is the second and fifth-biggest investor in BG and Shell respectively, said on Wednesday it would vote in favor of the merger.\nMany of Shell and BG's big shareholders have voiced support for the deal but a slump in oil prices below $30 a barrel has raised concerns that Shell may be overpaying for the smaller rival.\nShell said on Wednesday it expected the deal to go through within weeks.\n\"The completion of the BG transaction, which we are expecting in a matter of weeks, will mark the start of a new chapter in Shell, to rejuvenate the company, and improve shareholder returns,\" Shell Chief Executive Ben van Beurden said in a statement on Wednesday.\nBG, which will report full-year results on Feb. 5, said it expected 2015 production volumes to have hit 704,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), above its previous forecast of 680-700,000 boed, due to new fields that have come on stream in Australia, Brazil and Norway.\nThe news is positive for Shell, which is banking on access to new resource-rich areas, especially in Brazil, to make the BG acquisition worthwhile.\nShell said its asset sales in the past two years had amounted to more than $20 billion, far outstripping its original plan to make $15 billion worth of divestments.\nFor BG, the fall in oil prices meant it booked a $700 million impairment charge in the fourth quarter related to fields in the North Sea and Tunisia, it said on Wednesday.\nShell said it expected full-year core earnings of $10.4-10.7 billion which would be below the consensus market forecast of $10.8 billion. It will publish full-year results on Feb. 4.\nIt maintained its 2016-18 asset sales projection of $30 billion, provided its acquisition of BG goes through, and its 2016 dividend payment forecast of at least $1.88 per share.\nShell 'A' shares were down 5.6 percent at 1027 GMT and BG shares were 2.2 percent lower, in line with a 3.4 percent fall of the European oil and gas index.\n(Additional reporting by Camilla Knudsen in Oslo; editing by Susan Thomas and Greg Mahlich)\nNext In Deals\n",

REUTERS/Mike Hutchings\nBy Philip Blenkinsop | BRUSSELS\nBRUSSELS Anheuser-Busch InBev's CEO says a study of SABMiller's African beer markets and talks with top shareholders led to an \"alignment of stars\" that drew it to its nearest rival.\nBut observers say the real catalysts for the $100 billion takeover proposal made public on Oct. 7 are a steep fall in SABMiller's share price, search for growth beyond AB InBev's declining core Americas markets and a desire not to give SABMiller's new management enough time to execute a workable defense.\nAnalysts have speculated on the tie-up of the world's top two brewers for years. Chief Executive Carlos Brito told a conference call last week that his company has been eyeing its rival for \"quite a while\".\nIn the last few months though AB InBev has done \"deep dive\" studies of the top nine African markets, which would include SABMiller markets such as South Africa and Nigeria.\nAB InBev's larger shareholders, principally Belgian and Brazilian families, have also approached SABMiller's two main investors, cigarette-maker Altria and the BevCo company of Colombia's Santo Domingo family, which together own 40.5 percent of the UK-based brewer.\n\"Those two things were not the case a year ago, knowledge about Africa and knowledge about the intentions of those two shareholders, in terms of them being at least receptive to an approach,\" Brito said, while acknowledging that BevCo had not given its support to his proposal.\nTarget SABMiller has called the approach \"opportunistic\", timed to take advantage of a double-digit decline in its share price in July and August, depressed by weaker emerging market currencies.\n\"They saw an opportunity and they jumped on it,\" said Morningstar analyst Phil Gorham.\nLooking back, AB InBev's shares have outperformed those of its target since 2010, meaning AB InBev's market capitalization has swollen to beyond twice that of SABMiller from 1.6 times five years ago, making a purchase easier to fund.\nTROUBLE AT HOME\nWhile the share price may explain the exact timing, analysts say AB InBev's own performance woes and changes at SABMiller also played a role.\nIn just over a year, the world's second largest brewer has replaced its chairman, chief financial officer and the head of its U.S. joint venture MillerCoors. CEO Alan Clark has only been in place since April 2013, succeeding long-standing leader Graham Mackay who has since died.\n\"It's well-known that the management is not as stable as it used to be,\" said Berenberg analyst Javier Gonzalez Lastra. --\nSABMiller agreed a deal last year to combine bottling of soft drinks in Africa with Coca-Cola. Given time, industry sources say it could make its business larger or its ties more complex, making it harder for a predator to swallow.\nThe brewer tried last September to merge with Heineken but was publicly spurned in an episode that banking sources suspect helped make the company look more vulnerable.\nThere was also increased speculation among analysts and in the press about a possible tie-up between SAB and liquor giant Diageo.\nHSBC said investors should also not ignore the fundamental weakness of AB InBev's core markets of Brazil and the United States, saying the company has been driven to pursue a merger \"out of need\", rather than from a position of strength as it had in the past.\nIts U.S. volumes have declined in every year but one of the past six, with margins now slipping, while Brazil, a strong growth market for years, is now mired in recession.\nThe United States and Brazil make up just over half of AB InBev's volumes and some two-thirds of its core profit (EBITDA).\nExane BNP Paribas analyst Eamonn Ferry said AB InBev's U.S. problems were structural, with smaller craft players steadily gaining market share, while it was hard to see Brazilian consumers spending freely for the next year or two.\nSABMiller has also been hit by the weakness of local currencies, notably the South African rand and the Colombian peso, but the markets themselves have largely been growing.\nAfrica, meanwhile, is expected to see a sharp jump in the legal drinking age population in the years ahead as well as increased beer consumption among a fast-growing middle class.\nAfricans drink 9 liters of beer per head per year, compared with a global average of 45. However, alcohol consumption is in line with the global average, meaning brewers do not have to find new drinkers, but only get existing drinkers to switch to their beers.\n\"SABMiller is exposed to volatile markets, especially in Africa and less developed Latin American countries, but Africa is in that sweet spot now. If you want volume growth, it's SABMiller. It's the last frontier of beer,\" said Ferry.\n(Additional reporting by Martinne Geller; editing by Anna Willard)\nNext In Deals\n",

Photograph: Matt Cardy/Getty Images\nTuesday 12 April 2016 13.01 BST\nLast modified on Tuesday 12 April 2016 13.39 BST\nClose\nThis article is 8 months old\nTesco has agreed to sell half its stake in Lazada, a south-east Asian online retailer, to China’s Alibaba for about £90m as the UK supermarket group concentrates on its home business.\nTesco said it would sell 8.6% of Lazada to Alibaba, the world’s largest retailer, for $129m (£90.6m) in a deal valuing the business at $1.5bn. Alibaba will invest $500m in new Lazada shares as well as buying out Tesco and other investors in the Singapore-based retailer.\nTesco will retain an 8.3% stake in Lazada after the transaction completes, including the issue of new shares, but Alibaba will have an option to buy out remaining investors within 12 to 18 months.\nThe deal values Tesco’s Lazada stake at significantly more than the £113m carrying value listed in its accounts last August. Tesco, which reports its annual results on Wednesday, classified Lazada as an asset available for sale for the financial year that ended in February.\nTesco results: analysts expect strong start to the year\nRead more\nThe former Tesco chief executive Philip Clarke bought 19.6% of Lazada in November 2013 as the grocer sought to improve its online capabilities in Asia. It has invested $124m in the business. Under new management after a series of profit warnings, Tesco has retrenched to overhaul its UK stores and has been selling international operations such as its business in South Korea .\nAlibaba, which sells almost 1bn consumer products, has overtaken Tesco and Walmart of the US to become the world’s biggest retailer. It is expanding beyond China , where it makes about 90% of revenue, and wants to tap into fast-growing south-east Asian consumer markets such as Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand.\nMichael Evans, Alibaba’s president, said: “Globalisation is a critical strategy for the growth of Alibaba today and well into the future. With the investment in Lazada, Alibaba gains access to a platform with a large and growing consumer base outside China, a proven management team and a solid foundation for future growth in one of the most promising regions for ecommerce globally.”\nThe deal will take Alibaba into a region where no single operator yet dominates. While south-east Asia’s growing affluence is expected to fuel growth in online shopping, many countries in the region lack transport and payments systems required for online retailing to take off.\nTesco said it would use the money from the sale for general working capital purposes.\n",

  "articleText" : "Business News | Sun Apr 19, 2015 | 3:30pm BST\nInsight - Britain's bank tax jump threatens to push HSBC, StanChart to new home\nAn HSBC sign is seen outside a bank branch near the Shard in London February 9, 2015. REUTERS/Suzanne Plunkett\nBy Steve Slater and Sinead Cruise | LONDON\nLONDON HSBC and Standard Chartered are looking at the viability of quitting London for a new home in Asia because a big jump in a tax on UK banks makes staying in Britain increasingly painful.\nSeveral investors told Reuters they want the two banks to do a thorough analysis on whether it makes sense to move after Britain raised the bank tax by a third last month.\nSome are expected to quiz bosses on it at shareholder meetings, including at an investor gathering in Hong Kong on Monday.\n\"There is a very clear risk that HSBC and StanChart reach a pain threshold where they think it is no longer worth staying in the UK,\" said Richard Buxton, head of equities at Old Mutual Global Investors, which owns HSBC shares and who said the bank was reflecting on a move.\nThe tax has increased eight times since being introduced in 2010 to ensure banks make a \"fair contribution\" after the financial crisis. The latest rise was seen as a popular move ahead of Britain's May 7 election.\nAberdeen Asset Management, the second biggest shareholder in Standard Chartered, with an aggregate 9.4 percent stake, said the bank should consider the option.\nSenior management are already assessing the situation, people familiar with the matter said. Four years ago, HSBC said it would review its domicile in 2015, although the bank declined to comment if or when any review might occur.\n\"It's a live conversation internally because it's an issue being raised by investors and sell-side analysts,\" said a person close to one of the banks, who asked not to be named as the discussions are private.\nThe banks, who make most of their profits in Asia, face a combined $2 billion (£1.3 billion) bill this year under the annual UK bank tax, up from $1.5 billion last year and almost double what they paid in 2013.\nThe Labour Party plans to increase it by 800 million pounds to 4.5 billion pounds a year for the banking industry as a whole, if it wins power, to pay for childcare for three and four year olds. Labour is neck and neck with Prime Minister David Cameron's Conservatives in polls.\nAnother hefty rise could be the final catalyst and force banks to move, Bernstein analyst Chirantan Barua said.\nHSBC, which has described the levy as a tax on staying in London, faces a bill of $1.5 billion this year, about 7 percent of expected profits. Standard Chartered is set to pay $500 million, or about 9 percent of earnings.\n\"TOO MANY MOVING PARTS\"\nHSBC says it has two \"home\" markets, Britain and Hong Kong. It moved from Hong Kong to London in 1993 when it bought Midland Bank and its most likely move would be back to its former home, one of the few places that could handle its $2.6 trillion balance sheet.\nThe bank began life in Hong Kong 150 years ago, with roots as a financier of trade between Europe and Asia. It issues most of the territory's bank notes and has made $24 billion in profits there over the last three years, compared to a $4 billion loss in Britain over the same period.\nLondon has been home to Standard Chartered since it was formed in 1969 and its most likely new home would be Singapore, from where most of its businesses are already run.\nAnalysts said the cost of moving could be between $1.5 billion and $2.5 billion per bank.\nHSBC told MPs in February, before the levy increase, the best location was still Britain. It had postponed a review in 2011 because Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver said there were too many moving parts to make a rational decision.\nIndustry sources said that could still be the case for both banks. They are trying to improve profitability, cut costs, sell businesses, deal with old misconduct issues and simplify. Standard Chartered also gets a new CEO next month, Bill Winters, who may want to raise capital.\n\"On a 10 or 15 year view, I'd be surprised if both of them are still here. But I don't think it's an issue for the short-term, they have bigger priorities,\" John-Paul Crutchley, UBS banking analyst, said.\nYet it could be worth it. JPMorgan analyst Raul Sinha estimated the higher UK bank levy will cut Standard Chartered's earnings by 13 percent in 2017, while a move away from Britain could lift its return on tangible equity, a key profitability measure, by 1.6 percentage points to 12.7 percent.\nBritain is also forcing banks to separate domestic retail operations by 2019, so if HSBC is serious about moving, it could spin off its UK business at the same time, analysts said.\nBut the complexity of all the issues in the mix make a decision difficult. These include Europe's pay rules for staff, the risk of losing staff, how capital and leverage rules in places like Singapore compare, access to capital, political stability, credit ratings and the risk of regulatory change in any new jurisdiction.\nBritain's strongest card is London itself, which has always ranked alongside New York as the most attractive global financial hub, in the Z/Yen Global Financial Centres index.\nBanks, accused of sabre-rattling with threats to quit before, are also wary of stepping into a political minefield.\n\"StanChart and HSBC might well be firing warning shots on their possible relocation to ... tell politicians they won’t be bullied,\" said Paul Mumford, senior investment manager at Cavendish Asset Management, which owns stock in both banks.\n\"But I think unless these firms start feeling that some politicians are in tune with what they offer the UK, then we might see genuine action ... the threat is there,\" he said.\n(Editing by Jane Merriman)\n",

  "articleText" : "Stakes High for AstraZeneca Heart Drug Facing Tough Competition\nOliver Staley\nShare on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp\nIf AstraZeneca Plc hopes to fend off another takeover attempt, it needs heart drug Brilinta to become a blockbuster. It has to overcome tough competition to get there.\nThe second-largest U.K. drugmaker yesterday announced promising results for a trial of the anti-clotting pill, indicating that more patients could benefit from Brilinta, which has been a disappointment in the U.S. since its 2011 debut. AstraZeneca sold $283 million of the pill in 2013, yet has told investors that it can reach $3.5 billion in revenue by 2023.\nChief Executive Officer Pascal Soriot identified the pill as one of five key growth areas while rebuffing Pfizer Inc.’s proposed acquisition last year. In May, Soriot said he could boost AstraZeneca’s annual revenue to $45 billion by 2023, a 75 percent gain over a decade. To get there, Brilinta will have to take market share from generic rivals favored by doctors.\n“It’s a pretty tall order in the face of generic competition,” said Nicholas Turner, an analyst with Mirabaud Securities Ltd. in London, who recommends selling AstraZeneca stock. “They’ve got their work cut out.”\nOther analysts are also skeptical that Brilinta, sold as Brilique in Europe, will be a powerhouse. Six analysts estimate it will generate average sales of $1.3 billion for 2020.\nAstraZeneca dropped for a second day, declining 2.4 percent to 4,568.50 pence in London trading as of 11:37 a.m. That pares the stock’s gain to 22 percent over the past 12 months, similar to the advance in the Bloomberg Europe Pharmaceutical Index.\nBellwether Drug\n“People are looking at Brilinta as a bit of a bellwether,” said Tom Keith-Roach, AstraZeneca’s vice-president in charge of the drug. “People are looking at whether we can deliver what we say we can deliver.”\nOral antiplatelets such as Brilinta are a critical part of the therapy for heart attack victims to keep blood flowing, and for patients who have stents inserted into arteries.\nAspirin is the cheapest and most commonly prescribed antiplatelet, though doctors typically prescribe a second drug as well. For about a decade, that has usually been clopidogrel, a drug sold as Plavix by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Sanofi that generated $9.9 billion in revenue in 2011. It has been available in generic versions since 2012.\nBecause generic clopidogrel is far cheaper, costing about $12 a month compared to about $270 for Brilinta, AstraZeneca has invested millions in clinical trails to prove its drug is better. Almost 80,000 patients will be enrolled in five studies, the first of which was started in 2006, making it the largest program in the company’s history.\nPegasus Results\nThe second of those studies, called the Pegasus trial, yielded initial results announced yesterday that indicated patients may benefit from the drug more than a year after a heart attack. Patients currently take anti-clotting drugs for about a year after a heart attack, and then switch to aspirin alone.\nThe latest “results will continue to build positive momentum and confidence behind the brand,” Keith-Roach said yesterday. “We’ll see consistent growth and strengthening momentum over the course of the next three or four years as these studies read out.”\nAstraZeneca’s hope is that sales of the drug will double or triple if it can be prescribed far beyond a year, Turner said. That assumes doctors won’t instead just put patients on generic clopidogrel, even though it’s not been proven in trials, he said.\n“It’s quite reasonable to assume that the positive result in Pegasus could be translated” to generics, he said.\nThe full results of the Pegasus trial, which will be released later this year, will be critical for its sales, said Sam Fazeli, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.\nResults ‘Critical’\n“It all depends on the strength of the data they get,” he said. “If they come out all guns blazing, it will be very hard for a doctor not to prescribe it.”\nSo far, doctors in the U.S. have been wary, particularly as questions were raised starting in 2010 after U.S. and Canadian study participants fared worse than patients elsewhere in the initial trials. That led U.S. regulators to ask for more information and the U.S. Department of Justice began a probe in 2013.\nAstraZeneca said the results were probably affected by the higher doses of aspirin that U.S. patients took, and the drug was approved in the U.S. in 2011. The Department of Justice dropped its inquiry last year.\nCost Pressure\nCost is also a factor, said Oscar Cingolani , the associate director of the coronary care unit at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. If patients aren’t going to take Brilinta because they can’t afford it, it makes sense to prescribe the lower-cost alternative, Cingolani said.\nStill, Brilinta -- whose chemical name is ticagrelor -- was suggested as the preferred option in new guidelines issued last year by the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology for the treatment of heart attacks in which arteries aren’t completely blocked, as well as in unstable angina. The combined condition, called NSTE-ACS, affects more than 625,000 U.S. patients a year.\n“When it comes to the bottom line, reducing complications, morbidity and mortality, ticagrelor stands out,” said Ezra Amsterdam, a professor at the University of California at Davis and the chair of the committee that wrote the guidelines.\nBrilinta is important for more than just AstraZeneca’s sales. It’s also a test of the company’s ability to sell a specialty drug in a market with tougher regulations and resistance to higher prices.\nPoor Sales\nSales were poor when Brilinta debuted in 2011 in part because the company had to learn how to sell to hospital systems that make prescribing decisions, said AstraZeneca’s Keith-Roach.\nAstraZeneca didn’t support the drug with the necessary resources when it debuted, and now is spending on developing its sales force and educating doctors, he said.\n“This has been a massive change in our organization,” Keith-Roach said. “We have basically ripped up the playbook, and written a new one.”\nThe company now has a sales force of about 2,000 pushing the pill. The goal is to reach the decision makers who add Brilinta to hospital emergency room protocols, and not just the doctors who treat patients, he said.\nTo effectively unleash its army of salespeople, AstraZeneca needs powerful results from Pegasus and from future studies, Fazeli said.\n“The drug isn’t going to start selling itself,” he said. “You need clinical data behind it.”\nFor related stories and information: AstraZeneca’s Brilinta Heart Drug Boosted by Trial Result AstraZeneca Counters Pfizer\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

  "articleText" : "Business News | Wed Oct 14, 2015 | 9:43am BST\nHargreaves Lansdown draws in record amounts of cash\nBy Simon Jessop | LONDON\nLONDON Fund firm Hargreaves Lansdown (HRGV.L) defied a volatile quarter for global stock markets to draw in a record amount of new cash from investors, sending its shares higher on Wednesday.\nGlobal markets have been hit by a stock market collapse in China and concern around the economic outlook, particularly as the United States inches closer to raising rates.\nThat meant the total value of assets administered by the firm dipped by 500 million pounds to 54.7 billion pounds in the quarter to end-September.\nHowever, clients seeking improved returns as stock prices fell pumped a record amount of money into third-party funds listed on its platform and other products provided by a firm referred to as a fund supermarket.\nNew business inflows were up 47 percent on the prior year to 1.43 billion pounds during the quarter, Hargreaves said.\nThese were buoyed by transfers of money into the company's pension products as it benefits from a relaxation of retirement investment rules in Britain this year.\nThe new business also included 370 million pounds in client assets bought from JPMorgan Asset Management.\n\"We are particularly pleased with the reported trading data for the first quarter of the financial year given lower stock markets and weakness in investor confidence during the period,\" said Chief Executive Ian Gorham.\nShares in Hargreaves were up 7.2 percent at 0830 GMT, leading gainers in a 0.6 percent weaker FTSE 100 .FTSE .\nThe 1 percent hit to asset values at Hargreaves follows a 2.3 percent decline at asset manager Jupiter Fund Management (JUP.L) and compares favourably with a 6.6 percent fall in the FTSE All-Share index over the quarter.\nHargreaves also noted strong interest in the forthcoming  sale of government shares in Lloyds Banking Group (LLOY.L) to private investors, which could benefit the company.\n\"Early indications suggest considerable interest in next year's Lloyds share sale. A sizeable number of people buy their first ever share via an IPO, and retail share offers are therefore very important in encouraging the UK public to invest,\" it said.\nCalling the results \"solid\", analyst Paul McGinnis at Shore Capital said the demand for Lloyds showed a \"strong parallel with the Royal Mail IPO two years ago, which generated a huge surge in new customer sign-ups\".\nWhile a \"huge admirer\" of the Hargreaves Lansdown business model, McGinnis said he maintained a \"hold\" recommendation on valuation grounds.\n(Reporting by Simon Jessop, editing by Sinead Cruise)\nNext In Business News\n",

Getty\nBritvic, the owner of Pepsi, Robinsons squash and Fruit Shoot, is planning to make further changes to the recipe of its drinks to comply with the UK sugar tax , expected to be introduced in 2018.\nSimon Litherland, Britvic’s chief executive, said the company is aiming to reduce the calories of its drinks by 20 per cent by 2020, as he identified changes in consumer preferences to “sugar, natural and artificial sweeteners” as the biggest risk to his business.\nHe said the soft drink maker was “well placed” and prepared for the change.\nA sugar shortage will hit price of drinks and snacks 'this year'\n“As the category leader, removing added sugar from this family brand is appropriate for the long term as consumers seek ‘better for you’ soft drinks,” Mr Litherland said.\nHe added that Britvic had taken significant steps in recent years to reduce added sugar and reformulate drinks.\nMr Litherland admitted that the company was disappointed with the Government’s plan, saying he believes a holistic approach rather than a tax on sugary drinks is necessary to tackle obesity.  \nHowever, Britvic remains determined to engage fully in the Government consultation process to take place this summer.\nTwo-thirds of the beverages from the company’s UK portfolio do not contain enough sugar to be taxed. Britivc has already been reducing sugar in its drinks for the past four years.\nLast year its juice drink Drench went through a £2m rebrand, which included new packaging and a lower-sugar recipe. Sales of Robinsons fruit squash fell last year after the firm removed its added-sugar variant. \nThe company said growth was still possible despite the proposed tax. Britvic also been contracted to stock drinks in Subway, the fast-food sandwich chain, in the UK.\nRead more\n",

  "articleText" : "CEO Staley adds another executive from U.S. bank to top team\nPaul Compton replaces Jonathan Moulds at British lender\nShare on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp\nBarclays Plc named Paul Compton chief operating officer, poaching another senior executive from JPMorgan Chase & Co. for the U.K. bank’s top management team.\nCompton, who worked for the U.S. bank since 1997 and was most recently chief administrative officer, starts in May and will report to Chief Executive Officer Jes Staley, London-based Barclays said in a statement Tuesday. He replaces Jonathan Moulds, who’s leaving after just over a year at the company.\nStaley, a former CEO of JPMorgan’s investment bank, has installed his own lieutenants in Barclays’s senior executive ranks since starting Dec. 1, hiring C.S. “Venkat” Venkatakrishnan as chief risk officer two weeks ago, also from JPMorgan. Staley has imposed a hiring freeze and is cutting jobs at the investment bank as he moves to reduce costs to improve profitability. The lender is due to present a broader strategic update with full-year results on March 1.\nCompton’s responsibilities will include operations and technology, structural reform, cost cutting, sourcing and administration, and he will oversee the bank’s operating committee, according to the statement.\nJPMorgan Influx\n“For nearly 20 years Mr. Compton has served in a variety of senior operating roles,” Staley said in the statement. “His huge directly relevant experience will prove invaluable as we continue our strategic transformation and manage the required changes under structural reform.”\nCompton will join at least four other members of the 12-person executive committee that also built their careers at JPMorgan. Staley spent 34 years at the New York-based firm, including stints running its asset-management and investment-bank divisions. Finance Director Tushar Morzaria joined Barclays from JPMorgan in 2013 and head of compliance Michael Roemer spent 23 years at the U.S. bank.\nMoulds was asked to step aside as COO by Staley, who wanted to install his own choice in the role, according to a person familiar with the move, who asked not identified because they aren’t authorized to speak about the matter publicly. Staley “would have liked him to have stayed with the company in another capacity,” the CEO said in the statement.\nFormer CEO Antony Jenkins, who was fired in July, appointed Moulds, a 15-year veteran of Bank of America Merrill Lynch, in January 2015.\nJPMorgan Changes\nCompton served as co-CAO and chief financial officer of JPMorgan’s investment bank under Staley. He previously worked at Ernst & Young LLP, according to his biography on the\nwebsite of the Deposit Trust & Clearing Corp., where he serves on the board of directors.\nJPMorgan’s corporate technology group, which is run by Chief Information Officer Dana Deasy and had been overseen by Compton, will now report directly to COO Matt Zames, said Joe Evangelisti, a bank spokesman. Smaller staff groups that Compton led will report temporarily to Zames, Evangelisti said.\nBarclays fell 4.7 percent to 156.25 pence in London on Tuesday, extending its decline this year to 29 percent. The stock also dropped about 10 percent in both 2014 and 2015.\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal. LEARN MORE\n",

REUTERS/Carlo Allegri\nBy Jonathan Stempel\nBarclays Plc will pay more than $13.75 million to settle U.S. regulatory charges that it let retail brokerage customers make unsuitable mutual fund transactions, including more than 6,100 fund switches, over a five-year period.\nThe Financial Industry Regulatory Authority on Tuesday said the London-based bank's Barclays Capital Inc unit will pay more than $10 million in restitution, including interest, to affected customers, and was fined $3.75 million.\nBarclays did not admit or deny wrongdoing in agreeing to the settlement, which includes a censure. A spokesman had no immediate comment.\nFINRA said that from January 2010 to June 2015, Barclays' inadequate supervisory procedures failed to stop many customers from swapping one mutual fund for another when the benefits of switching might be undermined by the transaction costs.\nThis caused $8.63 million of harm to customers, most of whom were not warned of such costs, the regulator said.\nFINRA also said that from March to August 2014, Barclays processed 1,723 fund transactions, or 39 percent of those it reviewed, that were inconsistent with its customers' goals, risk tolerance or other investments. It said 343 of these transactions caused more than $818,000 of customer harm.\nDuring the same period, Barclays also failed to provide \"breakpoint\" discounts to reduce front-end sales charges on 98 large purchases of Class A fund shares, FINRA said.\n\"The proper supervision of mutual fund switching and breakpoint discounts is essential to the protection of retail mutual fund investors,\" FINRA enforcement chief Brad Bennett said in a statement.\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Meredith Mazzilli)\nNext In Money\n",

Chief Executive Officer Pascal Soriot said combination therapies will give the company an edge as it races Bristol-Meyers Squibb Co., Merck & Co. and Roche Holdings AG to develop a new generation of cancer treatments. Last week, AstraZeneca announced partnerships with Heptares Therapeutics and Mirati Therapeutics.\nInovio considered working with one of the other companies developing immune therapies, but “liked MediImmune because they were a little bit more hungry,” said Chief Executive Officer Joseph Kim. “They will do what it takes to leapfrog the other players.”\nInovio’s vaccine, called INO-3112, is in early to mid-stage clinical trials for cervical and head and neck cancers. AstraZeneca will shoulder all development costs for the drug and Inovio will be entitled to royalties on product sales. The two companies also agreed to develop up to two additional DNA-based cancer vaccine products not included in Inovio’s current product pipeline.\nCancer vaccines have had a “dismal” record up to now, Kim said. Inovio’s drug is different because it uses DNA sequencing technology to activate the T-cells that attack tumors, he said.\n“The bottom line, it’s all about the T-cell,” Kim said.\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

REUTERS/Suzanne Plunkett\n4/4\nBy Ben Hirschler | LONDON\nLONDON Shire Plc has agreed to buy U.S. group NPS Pharmaceuticals Inc for $5.2 billion, the Dublin-based drugmaker's biggest acquisition yet as it seeks to strengthen  its position in the lucrative field of medicines for rare diseases.\nThe takeover continues the breakneck pace of deal-making seen last year in the pharmaceuticals sector, as companies jockey for promising assets amid a wave of new drugs emerging from research laboratories, and Shire's chief executive, Flemming Ornskov, told Reuters he would keep looking for more deals to grow the company into a biotech powerhouse.\nShire will pay $46 per NPS share, representing a premium of nearly 10 percent to NPS's Friday close, the two companies said on Sunday.\nThe move will not come as a huge surprise, since Shire was first linked to NPS in May 2014. When plans for Shire to sell itself to AbbVie Inc fell apart in October, Shire said it could take another look at previous deal prospects and reports of Shire's interest resurfaced in mid-December.\n\"This is about growth and rare diseases, and it fits hand in glove with our strategy and our franchise,\" Ornskov said.\nShire expects the all-cash deal to add to its adjusted earnings from 2016 onward. It believes it can achieve cost savings of approximately 25 percent to 35 percent of consensus forecasts for NPS's standalone future operating cost base from 2017.\nAnalysts at Jefferies said the deal could boost earnings per share from 2016 by at least 12 percent. Shares in Shire edged slightly lower in morning trade on Monday, however, since the NPS deal is likely to reduce talk of Shire as a takeover target.\nCALCULATED RISK\nThe acquisition of New Jersey-based NPS will give Shire two significant new drugs. Gattex, a treatment for short-bowel syndrome (SBS), is already on the market, while Natpara, for hypoparathyroidism, is awaiting approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\nThe FDA is expected to decide on the Natpara application by Jan. 24. \"I am confident that Natpara will be approved on the 24th, however ... there is absolutely no guarantee,\" said NPS's  chief executive, Francois Nader. \"Given our interactions with the FDA, I believe it will be approved.\"\nNader called Shire's decision to conclude a deal before a decision a calculated risk on their part that nevertheless \"would provide the joint company the opportunity to deploy the most resources in supporting the launch\".\nThe consensus of analysts' forecasts for the two NPS medicines point to annual sales of $509 million and $534 million respectively by 2019, according to Thomson Reuters Cortellis, although Ornskov believes they may bring in more.\n\"Both of them have significant sales potential and some have mentioned the word 'blockbuster',\" he said. The term blockbuster applies to a drug with sales of $1 billion or more.\nThe drugs treat serious but rare disorders, which means they can command high prices. SBS is a potentially fatal gastrointestinal disorder that can leave patients dependent on  intravenous feeding, while hypoparathyroidism is an endocrine disease cause by absent or damaged parathyroid glands.\n\"ALWAYS CONSIDERING NEXT DEAL\"\nShire, which will make a tender offer for NPS shares, has secured an $850 million bank loan which, together with cash reserves and an  existing $2.1 billion five-year revolving credit facility, will pay for the deal.\nEven though NPS is a record acquisition for Shire, Ornskov expects the deal, which could close in the first quarter of this year, to be paid off quickly.\n\"We are incredibly cash-generative and this will add to that, so this does not prevent us from considering further deals,\" he said. \"Shire is always considering the next deal.\"\nShire's coffers were boosted by more than $1.6 billion when it got a windfall break-up fee after AbbVie abandoned its $55 billion takeover deal.\nCitigroup and Lazard acted as joint financial advisers to Shire, with Goldman Sachs and Leerink advising NPS.\n(Additional reporting by Natalie Grover and Deena Beasley; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Greg Mahlich)\nNext In Deals\n",

  "articleText" : "Published: Jan 29, 2015 5:42 a.m. ET\nShare\nBy\nJustinScheck\nLONDON--Royal Dutch Shell PLC on Thursday reported a rise in fourth-quarter profit, showing how it is resisting slumping oil prices, which have fallen more than 50% since the middle of last year.\nThe giant Anglo-Dutch oil company's quarterly profit on a current cost-of-supplies basis--a metric similar to the net profit reported by U.S. oil companies--was $4.2 billion, compared with $2.2 billion in the same period last year.\nFor the full year, the current-cost-of-supplies profit was $22.6 billion, up from $19.5 billion in 2013.\nHowever, Shell shares fell 4% in early European trading because the earnings came in below analysts' expectations. Analysts at Bernstein attributed the miss in part to Shell's loss-making North American shale business.\nShell is the first of the four big, integrated, non-state-controlled oil companies known as \"super majors\" to report earnings for last year's final quarter. Analysts and investors expect the weaker oil price to weigh heavily on the companies compared with the year-ago quarter. Shell, though, had been forecast to suffer less of a year-over-year impact in the quarter than rivals because its 2013 fourth-quarter earnings were dragged down by issues including high spending and poor refining margins, which prompted the company to issue its first profit warning in a decade.\n\"Our strategy is delivering with good performance on our three themes of financial performance, capital efficiency and project delivery,\" said Chief Executive Ben van Beurden.\n\"These will remain Shell's priorities in 2015, as we continue to balance growth and returns,\" he added.\nShell said capital expenditure in 2015 is expected to be lower than 2014 levels, with more than $15 billion of potential spending to be curtailed over the next three years.\nHowever, one area where Shell will be active is Alaska, where the company plans to start drilling this year, Chief Financial Officer Simon Henry said at a news conference. The company's arctic exploration has been bumpy in recent years, facing weather-related delays and mechanical problems including the grounding of an in-transit drill ship at the beginning of 2013.\nThe company announced a 4% rise in its fourth-quarter dividend to 47 cents a share.\nShell said earnings in its exploration-and-production division were $1.73 billion, down from $2.48 billion, with lower oil prices offsetting benefits such as increased high-margin liquids production.\nShell said its production for the quarter was 3.213 million barrels a day of oil and equivalent natural gas volumes a day, down 1% from a year prior.\nShell's processing, or downstream, business reported a sharp rise in earnings to $1.55 billion from $558 million, \"reflecting steps taken by the company to improve financial performance and the industry environment.\"\nShell's revenue in the quarter was $92.4 billion, down from $109.2 billion a year ago. Net income fell to $773 million from $1.78 billion.\nSince he took over Shell early last year, Mr. van Beurden has been trying to cut costs across the sprawling firm, scaling back big spending, most recently when Shell backed away from a proposed petrochemicals plant in Qatar earlier this month.\nBut the oil-industry landscape has shifted since Mr. van Beurden began as CEO: A year ago, Shell was struggling to control high costs at a time of relatively high oil prices. Now, development expenses are dropping as the oil price remains depressed.\n\"We are taking a prudent approach here and we must be careful not to overreact to the recent fall in oil prices,\" Mr. van Beurden said.\nWrite to Justin Scheck at justin.scheck@wsj.com and Rory Gallivan at rory.gallivan@wsj.com\nAccess Investor Kit for Royal Dutch Shell PLC\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=GB00B03MLX29\nAccess Investor Kit for Royal Dutch Shell PLC\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=GB00B03MM408\nAccess Investor Kit for Royal Dutch Shell PLC\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US7802591070\nAccess Investor Kit for Royal Dutch Shell PLC\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US7802592060\nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires\nMore from MarketWatch\n",

It looks highly likely this time around. Greece has been a handy reason to clear out of stocks over the past few weeks, with Fed-related jumpiness also playing its part,\" IG analyst Chris Beauchamp said.\nTalks on ending a deadlock between Greece and its creditors broke up in failure on Sunday, with European leaders venting their frustration as Athens stumbled closer towards a debt default that threatens its future in the euro.\nEuropean Union officials blamed the collapse on Athens, saying it had failed to offer anything new to secure the funding it needs to repay 1.6 billion euros ($1.8 billion) to the International Monetary Fund by the end of this month.\nAmong individual sharp movers, easyJet fell 1.7 percent after RBC cut its stance on the stock to \"underperform\" from \"outperform\".\n\"Our positive outlook for easyJet's summer has proved incorrect ...

REUTERS/Stefan Wermuth\nBy Matt Scuffham | LONDON\nLONDON Britain is planning to sell half its stake in Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L), worth 16 billion pounds, within two years of a possible first sale in September, sources with knowledge of government thinking told Reuters.\nFinance Minister George Osborne has indicated that he wants to begin reducing the government's 32 billion pound stake in the coming months, but the sources said the shares will be sold at a faster rate than previously expected, making it likely the government will take a substantial loss on the initial sales.\nFinal decisions on Britain's biggest privatisation have yet to be made and progress will depend upon RBS's performance, market conditions and ongoing investigations into past misconduct, the sources said.\nBritain pumped 45.8 billion pounds into RBS to rescue the bank during the 2007/09 financial crisis, leaving the government with a 78 percent stake. At current share prices the government is sitting on a loss of 14 billion pounds.\nRBS Chairman Philip Hampton, who is leaving the bank this year, and former CEO Stephen Hester had both said previously that it could take several years for RBS to return to private ownership, given the amount of shares to be sold.\nAlthough Osborne had been reluctant to sell at a loss, the bank's improving performance and the increased political leeway afforded by the Conservative party's majority election victory in May have persuaded him now is the time to sell.\nThe finance ministry declined to comment on whether Osborne will talk about an RBS stake sale when he delivers Britain's Budget on Wednesday, the first since May's election victory.\nBoosting the chances of a faster than expected RBS privatisation is a British and Irish economic recovery that has enabled the lender to recover debts it had previously written off and to lift operating profit by 16 percent in the first quarter.\n   \nINVESTOR INTEREST\nThe RBS revival has attracted interest from investors looking to benefit from Britain's economic recovery, including many in the United States, banking sector sources said.\nAnalysts expect the bank to have surplus capital by the end of 2016, offering the prospect of a high dividend yield in the longer term.\n\"Investors are really keen. They understand what RBS wants to be,\" one investment banker told Reuters. \"They are prepared to sit and wait. Pay up now for the prospect of a dividend in two to three years.\"\nRBS, which briefly became the world's biggest bank after an acquisition binge under former CEO Fred Goodwin, has undergone a complex restructuring to focus on lending to British households and businesses.\nThe turnaround, however, has taken far longer than that of state-backed rival Lloyds Banking Group (LLOY.L), which the government is selling at a profit en route to a planned return to full private ownership next year.\nA first sale of RBS shares to financial institutions such as pension funds and insurers is earmarked for September and could raise about 1.5 billion pounds, one of the sources said.\nYet significant challenges could still upset the plans. The biggest could be RBS's impending settlement in the United States relating to the mis-selling of mortgage-backed securities. Court documents filed last month suggested it could have to pay $13 billion to settle the claims..\nRBS must also pay the Treasury a further 1.18 billion pounds to cancel an arrangement that gives the government priority over dividends.\nShares in the bank were down 2.9 percent on Monday, in line with the European banking sector's decline after Greeks overwhelmingly rejected a rescue package from the country's creditors.\n(Editing by David Goodman)\n",

  "articleText" : "Commodities | Wed Mar 16, 2016 | 9:14pm EDT\nSaudi Aramco, Shell plan to break up Motiva, divide up assets\nThe logo of Shell is pictured at the 26th World Gas Conference in Paris, France, June 2, 2015. REUTERS/Benoit Tessier\nBy Kristen Hays and Erwin Seba | HOUSTON\nHOUSTON Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and Saudi Aramco announced plans on Wednesday to break up Motiva Enterprises LLC in a deal that ends a partnership of nearly two decades and hands control of the biggest U.S. refinery to the Saudi state oil giant.\nNews that the two energy companies will divide assets in their oil refining and marketing joint venture had been expected by many as they navigated an often-frayed relationship where their respective interests sometimes diverged.\nAn early sign of a pending breakup emerged last summer when Motiva announced plans to set up its own oil products trading operation separate from Shell. The desk started up in January.\nThe divorce also comes as the Saudi government considers selling shares in the world’s largest oil firm.\nAbdulrahman Al-Wuhaib, senior vice president of downstream at Saudi Aramco, said in a statement on Wednesday that the joint venture formed in 1998 served the partners' downstream business objectives \"very well for many years.\"\n\"It is now time for the partners to pursue their independent downstream goals,\" he said.\nA U.S. spokesman for The Hague-based Royal Dutch Shell said the breakup and split of Motiva's assets were consistent with Shell's plans to simplify its global portfolio.\nPROPOSED BREAKUP TERMS\nMotiva's three refineries in the U.S. Gulf Coast region have a combined capacity of over 1.1 million barrels per day, located within a 120-mile (195-km) radius of one another. The marketing operations support a network of about 8,300 Shell-branded gasoline stations in the Eastern and Southern United States.\nThe partners said that under the terms of a non-binding letter of intent, Aramco would take over the Port Arthur, Texas, refinery and retain 26 distribution terminals as well as the Motiva name.\nIt will also have an exclusive license to use the Shell brand for gasoline and diesel sales in Texas, the majority of the Mississippi Valley, the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic markets, it said.\nShell will solely own the Louisiana refineries in Convent and Norco, where it also operates a chemicals plant, as well as Shell-branded gasoline stations in Florida, Louisiana and the Northeastern region.\nA Shell spokesman said the company would move forward with Motiva's plan to integrate the Louisiana refineries to operate as a single 500,000-bpd plant.\nLONGTIME TENSION\nWhile sources close to the situation say the relationship between Shell and Aramco has been troubled, that tension grew after an ambitious $10 billion expansion of Motiva's flagship Port Arthur refinery. The project doubled its size to 603,000 barrels a day and surpassed Exxon Mobil Corp's (XOM.N) Baytown, Texas, plant as the country's largest.\nA disastrous leak of caustic fluid in a new unit crippled the plant shortly after top executives from Shell and Aramco unveiled the expansion in May 2012, upping the cost that already had ballooned from $5 billion.\n\"That was a continuation of the bad blood,\" said a person familiar with the relationship.\nIn February 2014, Motiva hired Dan Romasko, who had been the top operations executive at refiner Tesoro Corp (TSO.N), to replace former top Shell trading executive Bob Pease as chief executive.\nRomasko told Reuters in an interview a year ago that Motiva was \"coming into its own\" after the company announced plans to integrate the two Louisiana refineries.\nSources familiar with the relationship also said Aramco was said to be angry at Shell when refinery workers at the three Motiva plants went on strike in early 2015.\nShell led negotiations with the United Steelworkers union representing the workers, and the strike ended three weeks after the Motiva walkout.\n(Additional reporting by Liz Hampton in Houston and Josephine Mason and Jessica Resnick-Ault in New York; Editing by David Gregorio, Sandra Maler and Peter Cooney)\nNext In Commodities\nIran optimistic on OPEC deal after meeting Algerian minister\nDUBAI Iran is optimistic OPEC can reach a deal on limiting oil supplies and plans to announce its own decision about any output curbs at the group's meeting next week, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on the ministry's official website SHANA.\nSaudi wants OPEC to solve own problems before meeting non-OPEC\nDUBAI/LONDON Top OPEC oil exporter Saudi Arabia has told the producer group it will not attend talks on Monday with non-OPEC producers to discuss limiting supply, OPEC sources said, as it wants to focus on having consensus within the organization first.\nShell CEO expects no valuation hit from climate accord\nAMSTERDAM Royal Dutch Shell expects to pump out all the fossil fuel reserves listed on its balance sheet, its chief executive said, dismissing concerns that production limits in the wake of the Paris climate accord could hit the energy giant's valuation.\nMORE FROM REUTERS\nFrom Around the Web Promoted by Taboola\nTrending Stories\n",

  "articleText" : "InterContinental Denies Report of Starwood Merger Talks\nMichael Shanahan, Dalia Fahmy and Chloe Johnson\nJuly 30, 2015 — 1:43 PM EDT\nUpdated on\nShare on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp\nInterContinental Hotels Group Plc said it isn’t in merger talks with Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. after the Financial Times reported that negotiations had taken place.\nInterContinental, based in Denham, England, was up 4.6 percent at 2,743 pence at the close of trading in London, giving the company a market value of 6.5 billion pounds ($10.1 billion). Starwood, based in Stamford, Connecticut, fell 5.4 percent to $78.20 at the close in New York, the biggest one-day decline in nine months.\n“Following recent market speculation, the board of directors of IHG states that it is not in talks with Starwood with a view to a combination of the businesses,” InterContinental said in a statement.\nA Starwood acquisition of InterContinental would create the world’s largest hotel operator, with more than 1 million rooms in 100 countries. The talks are tentative and Starwood may chose a different partner or follow another strategy, the Financial Times reported , citing two people familiar with the discussions.\nStarwood spokeswoman Carrie Bloom declined to comment on the Financial Times article.\nFollowing that report, Reuters said Starwood had reached out to both InterContinental and Wyndham Worldwide Corp., which has 667,000 rooms in 70 countries. Its brands include Ramada and Travelodge. Citing people familiar with the matter, Reuters reported that Starwood has also approached sovereign wealth funds.\n“We don’t comment on market rumors or potential M&A,” Wyndham spokeswoman Margot Happer said.\nStrategic Alternatives\nStarwood in April said it was exploring strategic and financial alternatives to increase shareholder value. That fueled speculation that it may bid for InterContinental, which has been considered an acquisition target for more than a year.\nShareholder Marcato Capital Management LP, criticizing InterContinental’s management, last year called for a merger, arguing that could double the company’s valuation.\nStarwood and InterContinental reported earnings today. Starwood’s second-quarter adjusted earnings of 84 cents per share beat a Bloomberg analyst estimate of 74 cents. InterContinental’s first-half net income climbed to $205 million from $162 million a year earlier.\n“We never comment on speculation, and if somebody makes an offer, we’re a British company, and we’d consider it,” InterContinental Chief Executive Officer Richard Solomons said in an interview on Bloomberg Television on Thursday. Solomons made the comments following the company’s first-half earnings release, before the Financial Times published its article.\nInterContinental and Starwood have both been moving to cut real estate holdings to focus on property management and franchising. In November, Starwood sold its Sheraton on the Park in Sydney to China’s Sunshine Insurance Group.\nInterContinental this month agreed to sell the InterContinental Hong Kong to a group of investors advised and managed by Gaw Capital Partners for $938 million.\n(An earlier version of this story corrected a reference to a Reuters report.)\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

  "articleText" : "Relief for Lewis as Tesco sees sales grow for first time in a year\n \nWednesday 11 February 2015 01:12 BST\nClick to follow\nThe Independent Online\nTesco’s long, painful turnaround appears to be gaining momentum as yesterday’s supermarket data revealed that the struggling grocer had increased sales in January for the first time in 12 months.\nThe news will come as a relief for Dave Lewis, its chief executive, who is burdened by investigations by the Serious Fraud Office, the Financial Reporting Council and the Groceries Code Adjudicator into a £263m accounting scandal uncovered last year and alleged supplier abuse.\nTesco shares rapidly rose nearly 4 per cent to 241.85p as Kantar Worldpanel revealed that sales had increased by 0.3 per cent in the 12 weeks to 1 February, while Asda overtook Sainsbury’s to regain its place as the country’s second-biggest grocer.\nAldi’s and Lidl’s attack on the Big Four supermarkets has started to slow, although the German discounters continued taking customers away from Asda and Sainsbury’s.\nFraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar Worldpanel, said: “Britain’s biggest retailer is bouncing back from a tough year, with Dave Lewis’s efforts to overhaul the supermarket attracting an additional 236,000 shoppers into its stores in the last 12 weeks.\n“Despite the increase in sales, Tesco’s overall market share fell to 29 per cent, down by 0.2 percentage points compared to last year.”\nClive Black, a retail analyst for Shore Capital, said: “The Kantar data is good news for British grocers in that it records expansion after a sustained period of decline.\n“Within that it is very notable that Tesco UK has recorded growth, noting favourable comparatives, and this should put a spring in the step of Dave Lewis for sure. The cut in branded prices in January seems to have gone down well with shoppers.”\nHowever, some analysts said Tesco’s data was flattered by the Black Friday sales, which led to shoppers fighting over discounted televisions and appliances.\nInvestors were also heartened by the recovery at Morrisons, which is looking for a new chief executive. Its shares rose 5.8 per cent to 188.3p after  the industry data revealed that sales, though down 0.4 per cent, were the best since December 2013.\nSales at Aldi and Lidl grew by 21.2 per cent and 14.2 per cent respectively. But this was much slower than in earlier years. At the same point last year, Aldi was growing by 32 per cent and Lidl by 17.2 per cent. Mr Black said: “We have talked about the free lunch coming to an end for Aldi and Lidl and whilst still gaining share and so outperforming, the slowdown in momentum is also noteworthy.”\nElsewhere in the data, Waitrose boosted its sales by 7.2 per cent, staving off attempts by Aldi to overtake it as the UK’s sixth biggest retailer.\nKantar said that, by undercutting the market, Aldi and Lidl had helped drive grocery inflation down for its 17th successive period, knocking 1.2 per cent off average prices for the 12 weeks to 1 February.\n",

The supplier of wearable fitness monitoring gear said it was refocusing on business-to-business (B2B) sales after finding that selling to consumers was \"unsustainable\". Pre-tax losses for 2015 nearly doubled to £6.3mln from £3.8mln a year earlier as annual revenue dropped to £1.3mln from £2.3mln last time. The losses included one-off items such as a £736,000 stock impairment, up from £48,000 a year ago and a write-off of software development costs totalling £569,000. There were also legal costs of £594,000, a share-based payment of £473,000 and a returns provision of £216,000. Chief executive Anna Gudmundson, who joined the company last August, said it would focus on the service and software opportunity in the B2B market. She said the previous direct to consumer retail strategy had failed to achieve the results anticipated. Gudmundson said 2016 trading had started well with first quarter corporate wellness sales significantly higher than in the same period in 2015.

By Roland Head on Wednesday, 21 October, 2015. Is There An Opportunity For Handsome Returns With Unloved Glencore  plc , Tullow Oil  plc   and  Premier Oil  plc ? By Dave Sullivan on Monday, 28 September, 2015. Dave Sullivan is on the hunt for bargains with three of the weeks biggest fallers: Glencore  plc  (LON: GLEN), Tullow Oil  plc  (LON: TLW)\nARM shares currently trade on a 2014 P/E of 53, but a 2015 forecast P/E of 32. Although that’s still quite pricey, I find it reassuring that the market is gradually allowing ARM shares to re-rate onto a more sustainable valuation. The shares remain a buy, in my opinion.\nBHP Billiton\nShares in mining giant BHP Billiton (LSE: BLT) didn’t follow those of ARM upwards this morning, despite BHP releasing a very solid operational update.\nIn short, BHP is doing it exactly what it promised. Expansion of profitable, low-cost iron ore production is being prioritised. Iron ore output rose by 7% during the most recent quarter.\nAt the same time, oil and gas output fell by 4% to 65 million barrels of oil equivalent. This was mainly because BLT is deferring new US onshore gas development in the face of weak prices, which seems sensible.\nIs BHP a buy?\nBHP shares have fallen by 21% so far this year. Although BHP’s shares trade on only 10 times last year’s earnings, they boast a chunky forecast P/E of 25.\nDo BHP Billiton plc, Premier Oil plc & Standard Chartered plc offer hidden value?\nIs now the time to invest in BHP Billiton plc (LON:BLT), Premier Oil plc (LON:PMO) and Standard Chartered plc (LON:STAN)?The firm’s shares trade on a 2016 forecast P/E of 47, but a trailing P/E for 2015 of just 6.6! These numbers show how hard it is to value a cyclical business using just one year’s earnings.\nWhy   I ’ d   Buy   ARM   Holdings   plc   And   BHP   Billiton   plc   Today .  Should You  Buy   ARM   Holdings   plc , easyJet  plc , UK Mail Group  PLC   And  Acacia Mining  PLC  Following Tuesday’s News?\nWhy   I ’ d   Buy   ARM   Holdings   plc   And   BHP   Billiton   plc   Today .  As Glencore  PLC   And  Anglo American  plc  Plummet, Should You Be  Buying   BHP   Billiton   plc   And  Rio Tinto  plc ?\nExpected dividend cover for the current year has fallen to just 0.54. BHP’s 7.5% forecast dividend yield suggests a dividend cut could be likely, but I’m not sure.\nBHP has a long tradition of maintaining its dividend payment through downturns. It does have the financial strength to do so, if it chooses. I don’t think a cut is likely this year, unless market conditions get even worse.\nDespite this risk, at less than 1,100p, I rate BHP as a strong long-term buy. Even a 30% dividend cut would still leave the shares with a yield of 5%. I don’t see any reason to be concerned, as long as you are prepared to ride out the storm and wait for prices to rise.\nIf you're looking for more high-quality long-term buys like ARM and BHP, I'd strongly recommend a look at \"7 Steps For Seeking Serious Wealth\".\nThis exclusive Motley Fool report contains details of a simple, 7-step stock-picking strategy which the Fool's experts believe could seriously improve your returns.\nBest of all, following this approach could take you as little as 20 minutes per month.\nThe \"7 Steps...\" report is completely FREE and carries no obligation.\nTo receive your copy today, simply click here now.\nRoland Head owns shares of BHP Billiton.

Reuters reported on Wednesday the deal was imminent.\nThe sale is part of plans by Britain's third biggest bank to shed continental European retail banking operations as it retreats from businesses that are unprofitable or lack scale. Barclays said it would book a 200 million pound ($298.5 million) loss on the transaction in the fourth quarter.\nMilan-based Mediobanca has been seeking to diversify from its core investment-banking business and expand in more stable, less capital-intensive activities at a time when regulators are imposing stricter requirements.\nWith the Barclays deal, CheBanca!, founded in 2008 and focused on digital-savvy customers with between 50,000 and 200,000 euros, will nearly triple its number of branches and its client numbers will grow by 60 percent to 770,000.\nTotal assets under management will double to more than 6 billion euros. The transaction coincides with a move by Italian banks to draw more on the private household cash to make money and offset weak retail operations.\n\"This operation immediately gives us the scale in asset management that we needed and allows us to take a leap forward,\" CheBanca! CEO Gian Luca Sichel told Reuters.\nHe described the 237 million euros CheBanca! is getting from Barclays as a \"dowry\" for restructuring and revamping the network, which he said breaks even.\nHe did not rule out that some branches could be closed in a country where most banks have been cutting their branch networks to reduce costs and are expected to continue to do so.\nBarclays for its part is likely to be left with more than 10 billion pounds, or 14 billion euros, of Italian mortgages on its books, which it is trying to sell. It had 13.5 billion pounds of Italian residential mortgages at the start of the year.\nThe bank has already sold retail operations in Spain and Portugal and is seeking to sell in France.\nOther banks which want to reduce their retail presence in Italy include Deutsche Bank, sources with direct knowledge of the matter said. Deutsche Bank has said any rumours about a withdrawal from the euro zone's third largest economy are unfounded.\nThe Italian sale will reduce Barclays' risk-weighted assets by about 800 million pounds and result in a small decrease in its capital ratio.\nThe deal will have a 20-basis point negative impact on Mediobanca's capital, or around 120 million euros according to analysts, but will boost profit from the 2016-17 financial year.\nBarclays said it would continue to operate investment banking and corporate banking services in Italy, and continue to manage its remaining retail mortgage portfolio. It is attempting to parcel those loans up and sell them to investors, including private equity firms.\n($1 = 0.9448 euros)\n(Additional reporting by Steve Slater, Paola Arosio; Editing by Mark Potter and Jane Merriman)\nNext In New Issues News\n",

In the interim, Strain will chair the management board and assume Philips' executive responsibilities, while new chairman Andrew Higginson will also spend more time in the business.\nStrain is not a candidate for the CEO position on a permanent basis, Higginson said last month.\nThe bookmakers' favourite is David Potts, a former Tesco  colleague of Higginson.\nPotts had a 39-year career with market leader Tesco. Having started off stacking shelves, he rose to head the firm's UK business and then its Asian operations.\nHigginson was an executive director at Tesco for 15 years. Both left Tesco in 2012 after missing out on the CEO job to Philip Clarke.\nMorrisons lagged rivals Tesco, Wal-Mart's Asda and Sainsbury's under Philips's five-year watch.\nThe firm has suffered because the discounters, Aldi and Lidl, are strong in its northern heartlands and it was late to move to into better performing parts of the market, namely convenience stores and online shopping.\nHowever, industry data published on Tuesday showed Morrisons' best performance since December 2013, with sales down 0.4 percent over the 12 weeks to Feb. 1.\nShares in Morrisons, down 23 percent over the last year, were up 1.7 percent at 183 pence at 1055 GMT.

The results come after the company disclosed last week that its chosen finance chief would not be joining after all.\nHighlights from Wolseley's statement:\nDuring the quarter the Group generated revenue from the ongoing businesses of Â£3,658 million, 5.9% ahead of last year at constant exchange rates and 2.8% ahead on a like-for-like basis including 1.4% price deflation.  Trading profit of Â£230 million was 12.2% higher than last year at constant exchange rates and the trading margin was ahead of last year by 40 basis points at 6.3%.  There was one more trading day in the period which represented Â£6 million of trading profit and there will be one fewer trading day in Q4.  Exchange rate movements increased revenue by Â£153 million and trading profit by Â£11 million.\nCommenting on the results, Ian Meakins, Chief Executive, said:\n\"Wolseley generated decent revenue growth in the third quarter in mixed market conditions and against continued deflationary headwinds.  The commercial and residential markets in the US held up well and we achieved good volume growth, though this continued to be partly offset by weaker Industrial markets and the ongoing impact of commodity price deflation which reduced the US growth rate by 2.3%. The UK heating market continued to be challenging and we continue to take actions to protect profitability.  In the Nordics, after an encouraging first half, construction markets were more challenging in the third quarter.  Recent revenue growth trends have been weaker and we have continued to manage costs and productivity very carefully while driving better customer service and strong cash conversion.\"\nOutlook\nDemand in several of the Group's markets remains subdued and we continue to experience the adverse impact of commodity deflation, particularly in the US.  Like-for-like revenue growth in the weeks since the end of the quarter has been 1%.  We have committed to further restructuring in the UK and Europe bringing the total expected costs for the full year to about Â£20 million.  We expect trading profits for the full year, before restructuring costs, to be in line with analyst expectations at current exchange rates.\n",

This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.\n39.9075116.397\nBEIJING (AP) — Mining giant Rio Tinto on Friday announced the launch of the next stage of a multibillion-dollar gold and copper mine in Mongolia following delays and political tension over revenue sharing and the foreign role in resource industries.\nThe underground portion of the Oyu Tolgoi mine will go ahead after Rio Tinto, the Mongolian government and another partner agreed on a $5.3 billion investment plan, the Anglo-Australian miner announced. It said production should begin in 2020.\nOyu Tolgoi became a symbol of tense relations between Mongolia and foreign investors. Expansion plans were delayed by disagreements over how to share revenue in the impoverished but resource-rich country between China and Russia.\nCritics of government agreements with mining companies complain too little of Mongolia's mineral wealth benefits the general public.\nAn open pit mine at Oyu Tolgoi opened in 2013 with an investment of $6.4 billion and employs some 3,000 people.\nThe latest agreement \"is a clear demonstration that the country is back to business,\" said the Mongolian prime minister, Chimediin Saikhanbileg, in a statement issued by Rio Tinto. He said the project will be \"a catalyst for further investments that will strengthen Mongolia's economy.\"\nMinerals make up 94 percent of Mongolia's exports. With demand from China weakening as its economy cools, Mongolia's own growth is forecast to fall below 1 percent this year.\nIn March, some 2,000 protesters who criticized foreign mining concessions gathered in the central square in the capital, UlaanBaatar, to demand parliament be dissolved and a new government formed.\nRio Tinto owns 51 percent of Turquoise Hill Resources. Turquoise Hill owns 66 percent of Oyu Tolgoi and the Mongolian Government owns 34 percent of the mine.\nThe investment \"will transform Oyu Tolgoi into one of the most significant copper mines globally,\" said Rio Tinto's deputy chief executive, Jean-Sebastien Jacques, in a statement. \"This is a long-term partnership, built to create mutual benefit.\"\n___\n",

REUTERS/Luke MacGregor\nBy Ben Hirschler | LONDON\nLONDON GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) may ditch a plan to return 4 billion pounds ($6.1 billion) to investors, some analysts believe, as the drugmaker prepares to set out its vision for the reshaped group and a new chairman takes the helm.\nInstead, Britain's biggest drugmaker could use cash flowing in from its far-reaching asset swap deal with Novartis NOVN.VX to support its dividend, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs and Berenberg Bank.\nGSK said last year it intended to return 4 billion pounds to shareholders in 2015 through a so-called B share scheme, following its $20 billion-plus transaction with Novartis, which was finalised two months ago.\nBut with the drugmaker's dividend under pressure following several years of stagnant growth, some believe it might make more sense to cancel the program.\n\"Momentum behind this capital return seems to have stalled,\" Berenberg analyst Alistair Campbell said in a note on Friday. \"With the dividend commitment under pressure, we think there is now a credible possibility the company will cancel the capital return in favor of supporting the dividend.\"\nScrapping the cash return could cut earnings per share (EPS) forecasts by 3-4 percent. But this would be offset by renewed confidence in the dividend, which offers a fat yield of 5 percent.\nWhile the company has promised that this year's dividend will be held at 2014's level of 80 pence a share, there are concerns about the outlook for 2016.\n\"Importantly, in the context of dividend yield, we believe that if GSK were to sacrifice the B share scheme, greater certainty on the dividend in 2016 and beyond might be well received by investors,\" Goldman Sachs said in a note this week.\nA GSK spokesman said it was company policy never to comment on market speculation.\nThe debate comes as Chief Executive Andrew Witty prepares to detail prospects for the new-look GSK at an investor day on May 6, when it will also announce first-quarter results. The company's annual meeting a day later will see new chairman Philip Hampton take over.\nGSK has sold its cancer drugs portfolio to Novartis, while at the same time boosting its consumer health business through a joint venture with the Swiss company and buying Novartis's vaccines.\nThis reduces GSK's reliance on risky drug development and increases its exposure to more stable consumer and vaccines operations, both of which have long-lasting products but, in the case of consumer health, lower margins.\n(Editing by Catherine Evans)\n",

REUTERS/Cathal McNaughton\nBy Carolyn Cohn | LONDON\nLONDON Aviva chief executive Mark Wilson said on Thursday the insurer could give cash back to shareholders, after it beat forecasts with a 20 percent 2015 operating profit rise.\nAviva reported a solvency capital ratio under new European rules of 180 percent, at the top of its 150-180 percent target range. A ratio of 100 percent shows insurers have sufficient capital to cover underwriting, investment and operational risks.\nWilson said the company's strong capital position meant it could grow businesses organically, and reiterated it could also make \"bolt-on\" acquisitions in markets such as Poland.\n\"Capital returns to shareholders are also on our radar,\" he said on a media call following the results.\nREAD MORE: British bank Aldermore's profit up more than expected\nAviva's shares rose 4 percent to 478 pence at 0825 GMT, the top performer in the FTSE 100 index.\nAviva bought rival Friends Life last year in a 5.6 billion pound deal, creating a market leader in life insurance.\nThe life and general insurer said it would achieve its target of 225 million pounds in integration synergies in 2016, a year ahead of schedule, and that it expected 1.2 billion pounds in capital synergies.\n\"The key question now is what will Aviva do with the additional cash - we think it will in part be used to hike future dividends,\" said Barrie Cornes, analyst at Panmure Gordon, in a note.\nAviva's operating profit of 2.7 billion pounds came in above expectations of 2.49 billion pounds from a forecast compiled by the insurer.\nIts combined operating ratio, a key measure of performance in its general insurance business, strengthened to 94.6 percent, against a forecast of 96 percent. A level below 100 percent indicates an underwriting profit.\nAviva said floods in Britain in December had cost it 132 million pounds.\nThe company said it would pay a final dividend of 14.05 pence per share and total dividend of 20.8 pence, up 15 percent from 2014 but below a forecast of 21.2 pence.\n \n(Editing by Sinead Cruise and Alexander Smith)\nNext In Business News\n",

  "articleText" : "Greene King's third quarter sales boosted by festive season\nGreene King has posted a strong third quarter book, boosted by strong Christmas sales.\nThe FTSE 250 pub operator and brewer said on Wednesday that for the 40 weeks to 7 February 2016, Greene King Retail like-for-like sales were up 2.2%, with a 5% increase in sales over the two Christmas weeks.\nSpirit Managed life-for-like sales also rose 1.1% for the period, with Christmas sales up 5.2%.\nLike-for-like net income at Pub Partners was up 2.5%, while volumes of its own-brewed products frothed up 3.9% driven by Greene King IPA and Old Speckled Hen.\nOverall, combined retail sales were up 67% after 40 weeks due to the acquisition of Spirit seven weeks into the period, with overall growth of 6% at Greene King.\nThe company said it achieved record sales of £6.8m on Christmas Day in the combined retail estate, led by food purchases.\nIt also revealed over the Christmas and New Year weeks, Prosecco volumes were up 69% while Premium Gin grew 77%.\nAt New Year a record 4,447 drinks per minute were sold in the last hour of 2015.\nGreene King said despite the current global economic uncertainty, its expectations for the full year are unchanged. The company remains confident it will deliver further value by continuing to develop and enhance the existing Greene King business while integrating Spirit.\nChief executive Rooney Anand said it was a strong performance, with all divisions trading well during the festive period.\n\"Our positive trading results are a testament to the hard work and dedication of our teams who gave our guests great experiences, with value, service and quality central to our offer.\"\nHe also said the Spirit integration is progressing, with encouraging signs from rebranded trial sites and progress in efficiencies across the business.\n\"Our focus remains on the development and continuous enhancement of our core Greene King business while successfully integrating Spirit, to create the UK's leading pub company.\"\nHargreaves Lansdown's head of equity research Steve Clayton said it looks like a positive start for the newly enlarged group.\n\"Greene King has a great track record of dividend growth and the Spirit deal appears to be sowing the seeds for this to continue a while longer, with the group using the boost to earnings to improve dividend cover, whilst still paying an inflation-busting 6% increase to shareholders at the interim stage.\"\nHe noted the acquisition of Spirit has given the group a step-change in scale.\n\"[It has] increased the exposure to managed houses and the South of the country, including the fabulous Taylor Walker estate in London.\n\"Managed pub numbers have increased from 1,064 to 1,548 as a result of the deal. The group is thus ever more exposed to casual dining, which is a market with a strong growth record as Britons eat fewer meals in the home.\"\nClayton said growth prospects \"look solid in a still improving UK economy\".\nShares in Greene King were up 28p (3.36%) to 862.50 at 0947 GMT.\nRelated Share Prices\n",

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\nBy Kate Holton | LONDON\nLONDON WPP outperformed global advertising rivals Omnicom and Publicis by winning big accounts in 2015, beating sales forecasts and saying it had made a solid start to 2016 despite some difficult markets.\nThe world's largest ad group said on Friday strong demand in North America, Britain and the big markets of Europe helped it post its best growth of the year in the fourth quarter, and make a solid start to 2016.\nNew account wins from companies such as Unilever, L'Oreal and Tesco helped WPP to secure 5.6 billion pounds ($7.9 billion) worth of net new business in the year, putting it at the top of the league table for new work for the fourth year in a row.\n\"We see WPP as the best positioned of the agencies group,\" said analysts at Liberum, noting the broad geographical footprint and the fact Publicis has struggled since it withdrew from a planned merger with Omnicom in 2014.\nThe Ogilvy & Mather and JWT owner echoed U.S. group Omnicom and French ad agency Publicis with a solid end to 2015.\nAlthough analysts welcomed the results, noting cost controls had helped lift operating margins, its shares gave up early trading gains and were down 0.5 percent at 0930 GMT (04:30 a.m. EST), with some noting that the outlook remained cautious.\nWhile events such as the Rio Olympics and U.S. Presidential election should boost sales, low oil prices, global economic uncertainty and the potential that Britain could leave the European Union in a June referendum were all likely to temper clients' willingness to spend big on advertising.\nWPP reported fourth-quarter like-for-like net sales growth of 4.9 percent, the strongest quarter of the year, giving it a full-year figure of 3.3 percent, slightly ahead of forecasts.\nThe group said it expected to produce a similar net sales growth rate for 2016 with an improvement in profitability and said it had already enjoyed an above-budget month in January.\nThe strong pace means WPP has continued to keep the pressure up on its biggest rivals due to its broad geographical spread and its strong growth in digital sales.\nChief Executive Martin Sorrell said that while Brazil, China and Russia were currently challenging, markets such as India and Indonesia were performing well.\nWPP was one of the first ad groups to target emerging markets such as China and it now has a target of making 40-45 percent of sales from digital media and faster growing nations over the next five years.\n($1 = 0.7076 pounds)\n(Editing by Paul Sandle and Alexander Smith)\nNext In Media Industry News\nSumner Redstone removes Viacom CEO and board member from trust\nMedia mogul Sumner Redstone has removed Viacom  CEO Philippe Dauman and Viacom board member George Abrams from the seven-person trust that will determine the fate of both Viacom and CBS  in the event of his incapacitation or death, two people familiar with the situation told Reuters Friday.\nSumner Redstone has power to remove Viacom CEO from his trust\nSumner Redstone has the power to remove Viacom Inc  Chief Executive Philippe Dauman, but not his daughter Shari, from the trust that will control his $40 billion media empire after his incapacitation or death, according to two sources familiar with the matter.\nPARIS Billionaire Vincent Bollore, the top shareholder in both media group Vivendi  and advertising agency Havas , on Tuesday evoked the possibility of a tie-up between the two companies.\nMORE FROM REUTERS\nFrom Around the Web Promoted by Taboola\nTrending Stories\n",

Unilever plc (LON: ULVR), British American Tobacco plc (LON: BATS) and PZ Cussons plc (LON: PZC).However, Unilever continues to have significant long-term growth potential. China is forecast to increase its consumption of consumer goods at a rapid rate and this bodes well for Unilever’s top and bottom lines. Furthermore, Unilever has exposure to a wide range of markets so that if one geographic region disappoints, it has a number of others that can pick up the slack.\nBritish   American   Tobacco  is a great  stock  to own in times like these because  of   the   defensive  nature of  tobacco  companies  and   the  huge profit the company has consistently delivered for years.

Centrica  is reporting this week so that may give us some confirmation  of   the  companies change in fortunes  and   the  outlook going forward.\n© Provided by Fool Centrica, Gas ring burning\nThe EU referendum is going to have an unprecedented effect on the markets. It’s likely we’ll see increased volatility leading up to and after the vote on 23 June. These defensive shares should offer some stability to a portfolio and investors should be considering moving some capital into defensive investments.\nUtility powerhouse\nCentrica (LSE: CNA) is a classic defensive stock and should hold up well over the next few weeks. I also think the stock offers considerable scope for growth in the next few years. The company pays a chunky dividend yield of 5.5% and trades on a forward 2016 price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 12. This is below its peers and illustrates that the company is somewhat undervalued. It surprisingly raised £700m in May to make two acquisitions and pay off some debt. This was a smart move by the company and shares are now trading above the placing price. Centrica is also set to divest a number of upstream oil and gas assets in the next few years, which should lead to lower costs. These divestments could also bring cash into the business, which may lead to further dividend increases.\nJ Sainsbury plc, Next plc & British American Tobacco plc: blue-chip bargains or value traps?\nRoyston Wild considers the investment appeal of FTSE 100 (INDEXFTSE: UKX) stocks J Sainsbury plc (LON: SBRY), Next plc (LON: NXT) and British American Tobacco plc (LON: BATS).Supermarket strains\nBritish   American   Tobacco  is perhaps the epitome of a  defensive  play, returning value to shareholders through even the worst  of   the  2008-2009 financial crisis.  Consumer staple giants Reckitt Benckiser  Group  (LSE: RB),  British   American   Tobacco  (LSE: BATS) and Diageo (LSE:DGE) have each seen share sell-offs in the first weeks of 2016. These companies sell products that people  buy  in bull and bear markets alike, enjoy pricing power due to premium brands, and have proven over the decades their ability to reward…\nRoyston Wild looks at the dividend prospects of  British   American   Tobacco   plc  (LON: BATS),  Centrica   PLC  (LON: CNA) and John Wood  Group   PLC  (LON: WG).  Cigarette play  British   American   Tobacco  (LSE: BATS) cheered the market during Thursday’s session after releasing better-than-expected financial results for 2015. The London firm advised that revenues slipped 6.2% last year to £13.1bn, with adverse currency movements driving the top line lower.\nTobacco king\nIn the face of lower tobacco volumes and fewer smokers British American Tobacco (LSE: BATS) is still growing revenues and profits. Tobacco companies have always made solid defensive stocks and have outperformed the wider market since January. British American Tobacco is the biggest tobacco company in London and it trades on the highest P/E of 18.3. This looks expensive but the company has significant growth potential. E-cigarettes are becoming ever more popular and should drive revenues in the future. British American Tobacco also owns some hugely important and recognisable global cigarette brands. The company is focusing on these brands and this is boosting volumes, revenues and profits.\nSoftware giant\n3 hot recovery stocks? Centrica plc, Genel Energy plc and Sports Direct International plc\nAre these three stocks on the cusp of stunning comebacks? Centrica plc (LON: CNA), Genel Energy plc (LON: GENL) and Sports Direct International plc (LON: SPD).However, with Centrica having a sound strategy through which to turn its financial performance around, now could be a good time to buy it. That’s not to say that further share price falls can be ruled out, but rather that in the coming years it could beat the performance of the wider index.\nNational Grid  plc   and   Centrica   plc  are still great investments! Alan Oscroft | Thursday, 19 May, 2016.  3  defensive   stocks  for income: National Grid  plc , SSE  plc & Primary Health Properties  plc .  2 steady  stocks  for  the   EU   referendum : National Grid  plc   and  Dignity  plc .  Royston Wild explains why National Grid  plc  (LON: NG),  British   American   Tobacco   plc  (LON: BATS) and JD\nCentrica  was created in 1997 when  British  Gas  plc  demerged into  Centrica   plc   and  BG  plc  (later BG  Group   plc ). The demerger  grouped   British  Gas's gas supply, services, retail businesses and gas production business  of   the  Morecambe gas fields under  Centrica .  Centrica  is the largest supplier of gas to domestic customers in the UK, and one  of   the  largest suppliers of electricity, operating under the trading names \"Scottish Gas\" in Scotland and \" British  Gas\" in the rest  of   the  UK.\nSage (LSE: SGE) shares are another classic defensive play and should be much less volatile than indices in the next few weeks. The software provider has also performed well over the last six months but I’m not sure this will continue in the long term. Sage released impressive first half results in May which saw revenue up 6.2% and operating profit up 1.9%. The dividend yield has slipped to just 2% and the company is trading on a forward P/E ratio of 20 for 2017.  It has good prospects and earnings are set to grow in the future but I think the shares are well valued. Even if the company doesn’t grow rapidly it’s still defensive and should hold up during increased times of volatility.\nThese three shares may not be the best long-term investments but can be used as important ways to shelter cash during volatile times. After the EU referendum, shares should fall less on a leave vote but still rally on a remain vote. This can be a great tool for investors to use in times of uncertainty.\nCould Netsuite and Sage link up in the next big tech deal?\nSpeculation has emerged that Microsoft’s planned US26.2bn tie-up with LinkedIn could spark more tech-sector takeovers, with Sage Group plc (LON:SGE) a potential winner or loser in any deal. The next big merger could be a takeover of cloud computing specialist NetSuite Inc (NYSE:N) or Ultimate Software Group Inc. (NASDAQ:ULTI), according to a Bloomberg report. And the speculation has continued, with market gossips tipping London-listed accountancy software firm Sage to be among those eyeing Netsuite, which develops business management software systems. But they say Sage is likely to be up against big competition for the California-based firm, with other possible suitors said to include IBM (LON:IBM), Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google, Salesforce.com Inc and SAP SE (ETR:SAP). Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), which already owns 40% of NetSuite, is also thought to be watching the situation closely. Rumour has it that some of the interested parties have even approached major NetSuite shareholders, who are said to be unlikely to accept less than US&dollar;120 a share. But sector watchers reckon Sage could lose out if Oracle buys the whole of NetSuite, sells it to a rival or enters a joint venture with a new shareholder. A market source said: “If Oracle or someone else buys NetSuite, it’s not good news for Sage.” Sage said late last year that it still had much to do in its restructuring despite reporting higher revenue and subscriptions.\nShould  income-seekers pile into  Centrica   plc  (LON: CNA), BAE Systems  plc  (LON: BA) and  British   American   Tobacco   plc  (LON: BATS) right now?  However, with  British   American   Tobacco  having excellent pricing power, it has been able to increase prices and generate higher sales and profitability. Looking  ahead , there looks likely to be more  of   the  same in this regard and with the company’s Vype e-cigarettes continuing to offer long-term growth potential, the prospects for  British   American   Tobacco ’s dividend growth are very upbeat.\nThese 3  stocks  could offer much more potential than their sector peers:  British   American   Tobacco   plc  (LON: BATS),  Centrica   plc  (LON: CNA) and GKN  plc  (LON  That’s because their potential rewards may substantially outweigh their risks  and   the  resulting margin of safety could lead to stunning share price gains in the long run. As such, it could be worth backing  stocks  of this kind to a greater extent than some of their index peers.\nInvestors who want to beat the market regularly and make consistent profits must read this free report.\nThe Motley Fool's expert analysts have written a report to give investors the edge by using 10 steps to make a million in the market.\nThe report will help investors make lasting returns.

No clear production or investment targets are expected to be included in the deal, they said.\nState-owned China National Petroleum Corp is Asia's largest oil producer and parent of PetroChina Co Ltd.\nBP will also seek to use the alliance to expand its operations in China, which have been limited mainly to a fuel retail joint venture. Its peers Royal Dutch Shell and Total have natural gas operations with CNPC.\nFor CNPC, the alliance could offer opportunities also to deepen operations in the North Sea and West Africa, where BP has extensive operations.\nA BP spokesman declined to comment.

  "articleText" : "BP set to shed 600 North Sea jobs\n12 January 2016\nClose share panel\nBP has announced plans to shed about 600 jobs from its operations in the North Sea.\nThe oil giant said the majority of the staff and contractor posts would go this year, with the rest expected to be lost by the end of next year.\nThe job losses amount to about a fifth of BP's North Sea workforce.\nBP said it was taking the step in the face of \"toughening market conditions\" but added that it remained committed to the North Sea.\nThe announcement comes a day after oil firm Petrofac said up to 160 UK jobs could go under a restructuring plan.\n'Long-term future'\nMark Thomas, regional president for BP North Sea, said: \"We are committed to the North Sea and see a long-term future for our business here.\n\"For example, in 2016, we are continuing to invest around $2bn of capital into North Sea projects and a further $2bn in running our North Sea operations.\n\"This will sustain many hundreds of jobs both in BP North Sea and our supply chain going forward.\nImage copyright PA\n\"However, in toughening market conditions and given the well-documented challenges of operating in this maturing region, we need to take specific steps to ensure our business remains competitive and robust.\n\"An inevitable outcome of this will be an impact on headcount and we expect a reduction of around 600 staff and agency contractor roles by the end of 2017, with the majority of these taking place this year.\n\"We are speaking to our staff and agency contractor management and will work with those affected over the coming months.\"\n'Huge importance'\nThe UK government's Scottish Secretary, David Mundell, is expected to hold talks soon with the Scottish government's energy minister, Fergus Ewing, over the announcement.\nMr Mundell said: \"The UK government will work with the Scottish government to ensure help is provided to those affected, including through the Job Centre Plus network.\n\"The UK government recognises the huge importance of the North Sea, to Scotland and the whole of the UK.\"\nFirst Minister job Nicola Sturgeon described the job losses in the North Sea as a \"crisis\" for those affected but insisted that the sector had a \"strong future ahead\".\nShe said: \"I think it is important to note and to welcome BP's continued commitment to the North Sea.\n\"BP has reiterated today its investment plans, both in capital investment and operational investment in the North Sea this year and has said that it sees a long-term future for its business.\"\nShe said she would ensure the taskforce, which was set up last year and is chaired by Lena Wilson from Scottish Enterprise, was doing everything it could for individuals facing the prospect of redundancy and the industry as a whole.\n'Major crisis'\nLewis Macdonald, Scottish Labour MSP for the North East of Scotland, said the job cuts were \"another huge blow\" for Scotland's oil industry.\nHe added: \"With so many jobs being lost in the north east, and no sign of a recovery any time soon, it is time to reconvene the oil summit held just under a year ago and for the SNP government to spell out what their strategy is for dealing with this major crisis.\"\nScottish Liberal Democrat MSP for North East Scotland, Alison McInnes, said \"real support\" was needed from the UK government if the North Sea oil and gas industry were to overcome the challenges it faced.\nMaggie Chapman, Scottish Greens spokeswoman on social justice, said the \"need for a plan to transition the Scottish economy away from dependence on fossil fuels\" had become \"ever more important\".\n'Very disappointing'\nJohn Boland, from trade union Unite, said: \"This morning's announcement shows the crisis which has gripped our oil and gas sector for over a year now is far from over.  It's another hammer blow for jobs and skills.\n\"We need an emergency convention of all the industry stakeholders - government, employers and trade unions - to tackle this crisis so we have a safe and sustainable industry for the next generation.\"\nAberdeen City Council leader Jenny Laing said: \"This is very disappointing news and a sign of the continued difficulties facing the sector, but we welcome the commitment from BP that the company still sees a long-term future in this area and is continuing to invest heavily in the North Sea.\"\nIndustry body Oil and Gas UK said the plummeting oil price had impacted heavily on activity across the UK Continental Shelf.\nChief executive Deirdre Michie said: \"While Oil and Gas UK cannot comment on the commercial decisions made by its members, companies are having to take very difficult decisions in what continues to be a challenging time, and we, as an industry, must be thoughtful and supportive of our colleagues who are being made redundant or facing uncertainty.\"\n",

  "articleText" : "Published: May 18, 2016 2:14 a.m. ET\nShare\nSarahKent\nLONDON -- BP PLC's head of exploration, Richard Herbert, is leaving the U.K. oil giant.\nMr. Herbert took on the role in 2013, when BP was working to recover from its 2010 Gulf of Mexico explosion and oil spill by cutting costs and finding new, cost-effective areas to produce oil and gas.\nBut since 2014, a prolonged slump in oil prices has forced the company and its peers to cut spending on finding new resources. BP expects to spend about $17 billion on finding and producing oil this year, down from nearly $23 billion in 2014.\nBP said Mr. Herbert's departure follows a decision to streamline the executive team managing exploration and production, known as \"upstream\" in industry parlance. Howard Leach, who is currently head of technical functions in exploration, will take over from Mr. Herbert on an interim basis.\n\"This simplifies and streamlines BP's upstream executive team, but the change in reporting does not reflect any reduction in commitment\" to exploring for new resources, the company said in an email.\nThe move is the latest shake-up in the company's upstream division. Earlier this year, BP promoted its exploration-and-production chief, Lamar McKay, to the role of deputy chief executive. Mr. McKay was replaced with the company's head of production, Bernard Looney.\nMr. Herbert worked with BP for a total of 26 years. He took on the role of head of exploration in 2013 after leaving BP to work for several years at Canadian oil company Talisman Energy.\nWrite to Sarah Kent at sarah.kent@wsj.com\nMore from MarketWatch\n",

Those deals followed adverse rulings by Cote.\nFollowing a non-jury trial, Cote ruled against Nomura, which sponsored $2 billion of securities sold to Fannie and Freddie, and RBS, which underwrote four of the deals.\n\"The offering documents did not correctly describe the mortgage loans,\" Cote wrote. \"The magnitude of falsity, conservatively measured, is enormous.\"\nThe case is Federal Housing Finance Agency v Nomura Holding America Inc, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 11-06201.

  "articleText" : "Market News | Wed Nov 11, 2015 | 11:02am EST\nUPDATE 4-AB InBev launches SAB bid, to sell MillerCoors stake\n* ABI sees savings of $1.4 bln from SABMiller takeover\n* Offer worth $106 bln based on Tuesday's close\n* Access to African growth key part of deal\n* Molson Coors to buy SAB stake in MillerCoors for $12 bln   (Updates with further reaction)\nBy Philip Blenkinsop and Martinne Geller\nBRUSSELS/LONDON, Nov 11 Anheuser-Busch InBev , the world's biggest brewer, launched its $100 billion-plus offer for nearest rival SABMiller on Wednesday and agreed to sell the latter's stake in U.S. venture MillerCoors to help win regulatory approval.\nAB InBev, whose takeover of SABMiller would be one of the largest mergers in corporate history, said it expected to achieve $1.4 billion in annual savings four years after completion of the deal, projected for the second half of 2016.\nThe deal currently worth about 70 billion pounds, or $106 billion, was clinched with an agreement for Denver-based Molson Coors to take over SABMiller's 58 percent stake in their venture, MillerCoors, for $12 billion.\nThat price tag is higher than some analysts expected, given the small group of potential buyers. However, they had not anticipated it including global rights to the Miller brand, which will nearly double the amount of beer Molson sells internationally.\nAt the same time, the savings target, worth about 9 percent of SABMiller's sales, is lower than expectations, although it does come on top of the $1.05 billion that SABMiller had already pledged during the bidding process.\nThe merger will combine AB InBev's Budweiser, Stella Artois and Corona brands with SABMiller's Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell and brew almost a third of the world's beer, dwarfing rivals Heineken and Carlsberg.\nThe takeover, which SABMiller's board provisionally accepted last month, would be the largest of a British-based company and the fourth-biggest overall of any corporation. It will be backed by a record $75 billion loan.\nGLOBAL SHUFFLE\nAB InBev is already leader in the United States, Brazil and Mexico, three of the top four markets in terms of profits.\nWith SABMiller, it is buying into Latin American countries such as Colombia and Peru and crucially, Africa, at a time when markets such as the United States are weakening as drinkers shun mainstream lagers in favour of craft brews and cocktails.\nAfrica, where SAB operates in 16 countries, is expected to see a sharp rise in people of legal drinking age and has a fast-growing middle-class developing a taste for branded lagers and ales. Beer consumption there will grow by more than anywhere else over the next five years, say industry experts Plato Logic.\nThe acquisition allows AB InBev to draw level with Unilever  as the fourth-biggest consumer goods company with annual revenue of $64 billion. However it will overtake Nestle  as the sector's biggest profit generator.\nAB InBev said it would seek a secondary listing and regional headquarters in Johannesburg, where SABMiller was founded 120 years ago.\nThe transaction is also a \"game changer\" for Molson Coors, its CEO Mark Hunter said, as it gives the maker of Coors Light and Blue Moon nearly 28 percent of the U.S. market, making it the second largest player.\nIt would add nearly $5 billion a year in sales and nearly $1 billion in operating income.\nHURDLES TO CLEAR\nAB InBev is offering 44 pounds per SABMiller share, along with a discounted alternative of mostly shares, designed for SABMiller's two largest shareholders: cigarette-maker Altria  and BevCo, the vehicle of Colombia's Santo Domingo family, who together own 40.5 percent of the target company.\nThose shareholders have accepted the alternative offer, the two brewers said in a joint statement. Altria said it expected to book a post-tax gain of $8 billion when the deal closed.\nSABMiller shares were up 2.0 percent at 40.54 pounds at 1515 GMT on Wednesday, with gains limited by a degree of uncertainty around regulatory hurdles before the transaction is concluded. The shares have gained almost 40 percent since speculation about an AB InBev approach emerged two months ago.\nHowever, AB InBev's confidence that the deal will go through is high, reflected by a potential $3 billion fee if it fails.\n\"With today's developments, execution is still important but they have a bit of breathing room,\" said Morningstar analyst Philip Gorham.\nAB InBev shares were up 1.6 percent. Analysts said the cost-conscious company would probably exceed its $1.4 billion savings target, having done so after previous acquisitions in the United States and Mexico.\n\"This is the estimate going in,\" said Bernstein Research analyst Trevor Stirling. \"This is guaranteed and there may well be potential for more.\"\nThe company said the biggest proportion of savings will come from combining headquarters and removing overlapping administration costs, but will also come from scale-based efficiencies in brewing, distribution and procurement.\nWhile the MillerCoors stake sale is aimed at satisfying U.S. regulators, it remains to be seen whether the new company will have to divest SABMiller's 49 percent stake in CR Snow, the largest brewer in China, where AB InBev already has about 14 percent of the market.\nAB InBev Chief Executive Carlos Brito declined to comment on China or its future as a bottler of PepsiCo drinks, given that SABMiller bottles Coca-Cola drinks.\nAlso unclear is the future of SABMiller's relationship with French wine maker Castel Group and stake in Turkish brewer Anadolu Efes.\nAB InBev's lead advisers are investment bank Lazard and law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer. SAB's advisers include Robey Warshaw, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley and law firm Linklaters.\n(Editing by Keith Weir and Susan Fenton)\nNext In Market News\nAnti-pipeline protesters told to leave North Dakota camp area by Dec. 5\nCANNON BALL, N.D., Nov 26 Protesters opposed to an oil pipeline planned to run beneath a lake near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation in North Dakota must vacate an area where thousands of demonstrators have been camped by Dec. 5 or face prosecution, according to U.S. authorities.\n",

By comparison, there was concern over market leader Tesco and Asda, which saw sales fall harder than the other supermarkets on the High Street.\n \nTesco saw sales fall 1.3% and lost market share, from 29% a year ago to 28.6% today, with Kantar revealing that sales in the grocer’s big-box stores were falling faster than all its competitors.\nChief executive Dave Lewis has already shut down 42 larger stores.\n At Asda there was also disappointment as boss Andy Clarke’s steadfast refusal to engage in the heavy discounting which has flooded the sector continued to send sales down.\n#GroceryMarketShare figures for 12wks to 24/05: Tesco 28.6% Asda 16.6% Sainsburys 16.5% Morrisons 10.9% CoOp 6.0% Aldi 5.4% Waitrose 5.2%\n— Kantar Worldpanel UK (@KWP_UK) June 2, 2015\nKantar said they fell 2.4% — making Asda the worst performing of all the supermarkets — and come a week after Clarke announced that sales for the first quarter dropped 3.9% and warned that 2015 remained challenging.\nThere was some good news for the supermarkets, however, as the price deflation which has plagued the market for more than a year showed signs of easing off.\nRelated stories\n",

REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach\n2/2\nBy Huw Jones | LONDON\nLONDON If the merger between London Stock Exchange (LSE.L) and Deutsche Boerse (DB1Gn.DE) goes ahead, it could be the final mega-deal in the industry as further combinations of such scale are likely to hit antitrust buffers.\nThe two companies will seek to overcome the kind of regulatory concerns that scuppered Deutsche Boerse's attempt to merge with NYSE Euronext four years ago, a deal blocked because it would have created a near-monopoly on exchange-traded derivatives in Europe.\nThey could argue there is less overlap between certain business lines in any one region, namely Europe, say industry experts; for example while Deutsche Boerse has a big European derivatives trading operation, LSE is largely absent from that business.\nIf the deal is cleared it would create a \"Big Four\" of trading powerhouses that outstrip rivals in terms of market value and global reach - ICE (ICE.N) and CME (CME.O) in the United States, LSE-DB in Europe and Asia's Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (0388.HK).\nEach would have such large global operations in shares and derivatives trading, as well as indices and clearing, that any argument that business lines do not overlap could not prevail again, say industry officials and analysts.\n\"The very big players are already starting to be in danger of running into antitrust anywhere they go,\" said Patrick Young, a consultant to exchanges since the days of the first LSE-Deutsche Boerse tie up proposal back in 2000.\n\"We are coming to the point where the great exchanges merger game is coming to an end, the great powers have been defined.\"\nRegulators would be unlikely to allow the CME and ICE to merge, for instance, given a combined group would have a near-unassailable position in U.S. securities trading.\nIt is also unlikely that ICE would be allowed to buy a combined LSE-Deutsche Boerse group as this would create an effective monopoly of listed derivatives trading in Europe, say analysts.\nIt would also be hard to envisage the Chinese government allowing a foreign exchange take over Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing, they said.\nSMALLER PREY\nIf the LSE deal goes ahead, any big exchange looking to expand might instead have to look to hoovering up smaller peers.\n\"There is no one else left to buy up. It would be a range of mega exchanges buying a couple of selective, medium-sized exchanges,\" said Brian Taylor of BTA Consulting, which advises exchanges.\nIn Europe, smaller exchanges themselves such as Euronext (ENX.PA) and BME (BME.MC) would be forced to respond to the increased competition from a combined LSE-Deutsche Boerse to avoid being squeezed out, said Christian Voigt, senior regulatory adviser in London at Fidessa, which builds trading systems.\n\"All those medium-sized exchange groups ... will be forced to find an answer,\" he said. \"If you are stuck in such a position, you either have to start to grow or focus on a niche or specialty areas so that you can differentiate yourself.\"\nA source close to France-based Euronext, which was split from NYSE in 2014, said continuing with its strategy of maintaining its independence was no longer tenable, even if the LSE-Deutsche Boerse merger did not go ahead.\nEuronext and Spain's BME declined to comment.\nA London-Frankfurt merger could also pose problems for U.S. exchange Nasdaq (NDAQ.O). It would risk falling further and further behind a Big Four as it does not have the same global reach or a strong presence in derivatives trading and clearing - among the industry's highest-growth and margin businesses.\n\"I do think that (LSE-DB) would be pretty much the last of the mega mergers and poses an interesting question for Nasdaq. Do they need to do a deal, what is their focus?\" said Rich Daniels, senior analyst at TABB Group in New York.\nNasdaq declined to comment.\nUntil the slowdown in China's economy, Asia was seen as a promised land for western exchanges wanting to tap the region's growth and realize a dream of becoming truly global platforms.\nHowever national political barriers make foreign takeovers in Asia more difficult than elsewhere, BTA Consulting's Taylor said. In 2011 Australia banned an attempt by the Singapore Exchange to buy the Australian Stock Exchange to avoid a foreign country having too much sway in its financial center.\nAnalysts say Asian exchanges are more likely to snap up western peers rather than the other way round.\nThe Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing bought the London Metal Exchange in 2012, while Singapore's SGX exchange is among the suitors for London's Baltic Exchange.\n\"I don't think any country in Asia is ready to open up to foreign ownership,\" TABB Group's Daniels said. \"I don't think that politically it is time for Asia to be part of truly global consolidation.\"\nCLEARING & BREXIT\nThe proposed London-Frankfurt merger has not yet been formally put to regulators, but a major area of competition concern could be derivatives clearing, as LSE's LCH.Clearnet and Deutsche Boerse's Eurex Clearing are already the dominant players in Europe.\nIndustry experts said the British company could spin off the French half of its clearing house in a bid to assuage regulators.\nLSE and Deutsche Boerse declined to comment.\nA core reform from the global financial crisis is forcing large chunks of the world's $550 trillion derivatives market to pass through a clearing house to complete the trade even if one side of the transaction goes bust.\nThe lucrative service becomes mandatory for interest rate swaps in the European Union from June, and ICE and CME have both opened clearing houses in the region in the past five years.\n\"A DB-LSE tie-up would create a European clearing powerhouse that would pose more challenges for U.S.-based ICE and CME in building a European swaps and futures business,\" Benn Steil, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations think-tank in New York.\nBut other factors could also shape the industry's European landscape, such as if Britain, home to the region's biggest financial center, votes in June to back \"Brexit\" and leave the European Union.\nThe EU is putting in place reforms to create a capital markets union to help companies raise more money by issuing bonds and floating on stock exchanges, but exchanges would need to have a presence in the bloc to exploit this.\nWhile the LSE and Deutsche Boerse say their merger would be Brexit-proof, Britain leaving the EU could force other exchanges with European headquarters in London - such as BATS Chi-X, ICE and CME - to review where they should be based.\n(Additional reporting by Noor Hussain in Bangalore, John McCrank in New York, Alexandre Boksenbaum-Granier in Paris, Jonathan Gould in Frankfurt, and Jesus Aguado in Madrid; Editing by Pravin Char)\nNext In Deals\n",

  "articleText" : "Diageo receives reports from United Spirits on financial irregularities involving Vijay Mallya\nBy ET Bureau | Updated: Apr 28, 2015, 07.05 AM IST\nDiageo said that it has received three different reports from USL which talk about various alleged irregular financial transactions involving Mallya.\nRELATED COMPANIES\nChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz\nClose ✕\nMUMBAI: British drinks major Diageo — also the principal shareholder of United Spirits (USL) — said on Monday that it has received three different reports from USL which talk about various alleged irregular financial transactions involving the company's non-executive chairman Vijay Mallya , UB Group entities and various other corporate as well as individual entities.\n\"Subsequent to its announcement on April 25, 2015, USL has provided its inquiry report and all related materials to Diageo. Diageo notes the recommendation of the USL board and will now consider its position under its agreements with Mallya and United Breweries Holdings (UBHL) in the light of the inquiry report and materials provided to it,\" Diageo said in a statement from London.\nET, in its Monday edition, had reported USL's intention to present these reports to parent Diageo, requesting it to review its contractual obligations with USL and oust him from his post. It is also expected to approach the Securities and Exchange Board of India with the same set of reports. It remains unclear if it has already done so.\nA detailed questionnaire sent to a USL spokesperson in India did not elicit any response till the time of going to press late on Monday.\nLast week, a PwC forensic audit into the company's books had found \"impropriety and violations\", regarding transactions of close to Rs 2,000 crore.Following the audit, the board of USL — citing loss of confidence — asked Mallya to step down.\nMallya has refused to do so and has said Diageo is contractually bound to support and vote along with him. Diageo, which holds a 54.8% stake in USL, said in its statement that it indeed has \"certain contractual obligations to support Mallya's continuance as non-executive director and chairman of USL, subject to certain conditions and in the absence of certain defaults.\"\nMaking public for the first time the contents of its Shareholders Agreement with Mallya, Diageo said: \"Under the agreement, the parties agreed to use their respective rights as shareholders such that, among other things, UBHL would be able to nominate one director (who would be Mallya) to the USL board. This right of UBHL is subject to it continuing to hold at least 1,307,950 shares in USL and Mallya continuing to control UBHL. In certain circumstances where Mallya ceases to control UBHL, Mallya may become entitled to succeed to the right to nominate himself as a director of USL subject to his holding at least 1,307,950 USL shares.\"\nIt goes on to say, \"Previously, UBHL also had the right to recommend a second, independent, non-executive director as long as it continued to hold at least 6,539,750 shares in USL. Following an earlier reduction in the UBHL group's shareholding in USL, this recommendation right has fallen away.\"\nTo give effect to these rights, Diageo is obliged, under the Shareholders Agreement and a separate agreement with Mallya, \"to support his continuance as non-executive director and chairman of USL. These obligations of Diageo are subject to the conditions described above and the absence of certain defaults by UBHL and Mallya\".\n\"Only shareholders can remove Vijay Mallya from the board of USL. For Mallya, to continue as chairman, it is essential that he remains a director on the board,\" said Ravi Singhania, managing partner of Rajani, Singhania & Partners. \"As per the Companies Act, in my view, the Board can appoint a new chairman without going back to the shareholders unless the Articles of Association provide, otherwise,\" Singhania added.\nHowever, in a contrarian stand, Sanjay Asher, Senior Partner of law firm Crawford Bayley said, \"There has to be good reason why the board is amending the existing clause and superseding the current chairman and director. Though the majority shares are owned by Diageo, the company will have to pass an ordinary resolution after calling for an emergency shareholder meeting if they want to remove Mallya,\" he said.\nStay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!\nDON'T MISSany stories, follow us on Twitter Follow\nFROM AROUND THE WEB\n",

REUTERS/Jim Young\nNEW YORK Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) on Tuesday disclosed a 5 percent stake in agricultural equipment maker Deere & Co (DE.N) and said it shed a $3.74 billion investment in oil company Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) as oil prices plunged.\nThe changes were among several that Berkshire made in its common stock investments in the fourth quarter, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing detailing the conglomerate's domestic equity investments as of Dec. 31.\nBerkshire began accumulating the bulk of its 17.1 million-share stake in Deere, worth $1.51 billion at year end, in the third quarter of 2014, but had not previously disclosed it. The SEC often lets Buffett quietly accumulate large stakes to deter copycats.\nDeere shares rose 1.2 percent in after-market trading.\nShares of companies often rise after Berkshire reveals new investments because some investors consider it a vote of confidence by Buffett and try to copy him.\nDeere declined to comment.\nBerkshire's decision to dispose of its entire 41 million-share stake in Exxon Mobil was unusual for Berkshire because the stake had been recently acquired, dating only to 2013.\nExxon shares have outperformed many peers in recent months, losing only about 15 percent of their value from June through January as oil prices slumped by more than half.\nIt is unclear why Buffett appeared to have soured on Exxon, or whether Berkshire made money on the investment.\nBuffett \"is of course a value investor, and the fact of the matter is that Exxon shares held up extremely well during the oil price meltdown,\" said Raymond James energy analyst Pavel Molchanov in an interview.\nExxon Mobil declined to comment.\nBerkshire also reported a new stake of 4.7 million shares in Rupert Murdoch's media company Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O).\nIt further reported a new 8.4 million-share stake in Restaurant Brands International Inc (QSR.N) (QSR.TO), the parent of the Burger King and Tim Hortons restaurant chains.

  "articleText" : "Retail and Consumer\nAldi to open more stores than Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons combined\nAldi to outgrow Tesco by almost ten times in 2015 as pressure on 'big four' is    laid bare\nAldi first opened in the UK in 1990 and now has more than 500 stores Photo: Bloomberg\nBy Graham Ruddick\n7:30PM GMT 21 Mar 2015\nAldi is planning to open more new shops in the UK this year than Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons combined according to comprehensive new supermarket research that lays bare the dramatic changes in the industry.\nThe German discounter, which celebrates its 25th anniversary of opening in the UK this year, plans to open 1.02m sq ft of shop space in 2015, the equivalent of roughly 60 shops.\nThis compares to just 450,000 sq ft for Sainsbury’s, 220,000 sq ft for Morrisons, and is almost ten times more than the 170,000 sq ft Tesco intends to open.\nThe findings from IPD, the commercial property industry’s leading research body, and Colliers, the property agent, show how the grocery industry has been turned on its head by the rise of the discounters and a slump in sales for the “big four”, which includes Asda as well as Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons.\nThe “big four” have expanded rapidly over the last two decades but have been forced to scrap new store openings to shore up their battered balance sheets.\nRelated Articles\nSainsbury's boss claims there are 'green shoots' of recovery for supermarkets\n17 Mar 2015\nTesco announced earlier this year that it was scrapping 49 stores as new chief executive Dave Lewis responded to a fall in sales and the discovery of a £263m blackhole in retailer’s accounts. The search shows that the amount of space Tesco will open this year is down 76pc on 2014.\nIn contrast, the German discounter Aldi, which now has more than 500 shops in the UK, is ramping up its expansion plans as it grows market share. After Aldi, Marks & Spencer has the most ambitious store opening plans and intends to open 600,000 sq ft of space. Asda plans to open 550,000 sq ft while Aldi’s rival Lidl wants to open 340,000 sq ft, double the amount of Tesco.\nOverall, 3.9m sq ft of space is due to be added to Britain’s grocery industry this year. However, in a shift from recent patterns, just 29pc of this will be traditional supermarkets. Instead, 54pc will be small supermarkets of between 3,000 sq ft and 15,000 sq ft, which is Aldi’s favoured size, while 17pc will be convenience stores such as Tesco Express and Sainsbury’s Local.\nJames Watson, head of UK investment at Colliers, said the grocery industry has “rebooted itself” as the biggest chains look to fightback against a change in consumer habits towards smaller and more frequent shops rather than one weekly trip to an out-of-town supermarket.\nHe added: For all operators, it is the consumer’s increasing predilection for online delivery topped up by convenience basket shops leading to the demise of the super profits generated by the traditional trolley shop that is at the heart of their problems. Grocery delivery is not an area where the operators can make profits – yet.”\nThe report also highlights that Britain’s pension funds could take a hit from the pressure on the industry because they own supermarkets across the UK.\nIn 2014, 86pc of all the supermarkets bought were by UK institutions such as pension funds, which is in line with the historical average.\nThe value of supermarkets is now under pressure as the profitability of the industry falls and demand to develop new sites slows.\nThe value of supermarkets bought and sold in the UK dropped by 27pc year-on-year during 2014 to £1.3bn. The report said there was £500m of deals in the second quarter of the year but then the “depth of problems facing the operators became increasingly obvious”.\nMr Watson the industry was likely to become split between prime and secondary supermarkets, with stores in the busy locations still likely to perform robustly.\nHe said: “Operator difficulties are being offset by an improving economic situation and a more constrained supply of new supermarket assets.\n“However, there is now a more clearly defined primary and secondary market for assets.\n“The secondary market has more pain to come.”\n \n",

  "articleText" : "Business News | Tue Sep 22, 2015 | 5:10am BST\nAnalysis - Copper market may get a 2003-style supply shock from Glencore closures\nThe logo of commodities trader Glencore is pictured in front of the company's headquarters in the Swiss town of Baar November 20, 2012. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann\nBy Josephine Mason | NEW YORK\nNEW YORK As copper miners start to slash spending and shutter mines because of the plunge in the price of the metal, experts who analyse the market in the base metal are suddenly getting a little more cheery.\nThey are seeing the potential for a re-run of 2003 when Chile’s Codelco [COBRE.UL], the world’s top copper producer stockpiled 200,000 tonnes of the metal that is used in everything from pipes to autos, providing the market with a supply shock that soon drove copper prices back up.\nThis time around hopes are pinned on the announcement earlier this month from Glencore (GLEN.L) of a sweeping strategy to shore up cash and cut spending, including plans to shutter two major, high-cost copper mines in Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo over the next 18 months. That will cut company output by 400,000 tonnes and remove some 2 percent of global supply from the market.\nFor Glencore CEO Ivan Glasenberg, the plan helped placate shareholders worried about $30 billion (£19 billion) of debt as prices of its main products from copper to coal sank to six-year lows amid worries about China's waning appetite for such commodities.\nThe company's shares jumped 7 percent on the news, although they have since come under renewed pressure, hitting fresh all-time lows last week. They are down 60 percent so far this year.\nFor the beleaguered copper market, it was the first meaningful supply-side shock since the start of the current year-long copper rout. It has the potential to help trigger a long, slow revival in prices, analysts and other experts said.\nThere is a big similarity with the market in 2002-2003, much more than the financial crisis-driven plunge in 2008, said Leon Westgate, analyst at ICBC Standard Bank.\nTwelve years ago, prices were languishing near 14-year lows and global inventory was skyrocketing. In response, the state-run Codelco built the stockpile of 200,000 tonnes of copper cathodes near the northern Chilean port of Antofagasta. It kept that material off the market until conditions had improved.\nA DIFFERENT CHINA\nThe comparisons with 2003 only go so far.\nChina devoured a record 9.4 million tonnes of copper last year, almost half of the global total, against just 3 million tonnes in 2003. The country’s average annual growth rate in demand of more than 10 percent over the past decade has plunged to around 3-4 percent this year, and that has been a big reason for the recent price slump.\nArguably the copper market was in a weaker state in 2003 than it is now. Global inventories of 1.5 million tonnes were three times higher than current levels, and at around $1,300 per tonne prices were about a quarter of current levels.\n    Glencore may find it tougher to implement its plan, which threatens jobs in Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo, than government-owned Codelco. But the events of 12 years ago could show how a major supply shock may be just what is needed to stem losses, eventually helping prices to recover.\n    Citi analyst David Wilson cautions against taking cues from macro events when producers like Glencore are showing they can respond aggressively to weak prices. \"There has been a clear dislocation in the recognition of reduced output growth versus copper prices, but for how long can this continue?,\" he asked.\n    SUPPLY DEFICIT SEEN\n    Combined with mine outages and China's emergence as a major buyer as its economy took off, Codelco's move in 2003 rescued the copper market from a prolonged downturn.\n    By 2005, prices had more than doubled to over $3,000 per tonne, global inventories had plunged to just 100,000 tonnes and the market was in the early throes of a boom that saw prices near $10,000 per tonne in 2010.\n    This time, few analysts expect prices to recover by that magnitude, and there are few signs of a significant rebound in Chinese demand, but Glencore's shutdown is expected to tip the market into a small supply deficit next year, Westgate at ICBC Standard Bank said.\n    ICBC and Citibank reckon an annualised 1.5 million tonnes has already been lost this year due to power outages, strikes, floods and drought, as well as lower grade source material from producers in various places, from Zambia to Chile.\n    Fresh cuts and stabilizing demand could propel prices towards $5,700 per tonne in the fourth quarter, Citi's Wilson said. That'd be a rise of 8 percent from current levels of $5,270 per tonne, which are down from around $7,000 per tonne a year ago.\n    Any other unexpected supply shocks or signs that Beijing is preparing to boost spending further on industries that use copper intensively could trigger a more significant rally into next year.\n    \"The market's tighter compared with back then. You don't need extreme demand to kick in because the market's already tight,\" said Westgate.\nLast Thursday, prices rallied to two-month highs after a powerful earthquake struck off Chile’s coast, forcing Codelco and Chilean rival Antofagasta (ANTO.L) to temporarily close two big mines, raising concerns about supply disruptions. The gains evaporated as the mines reopened and lingering worries about Chinese demand returned.\n   \n    FEW PRECEDENTS\n    There are few recent examples of wholesale mine and smelter closures because producers prefer to slash costs by shelving expansion plans or mining higher grades. Late last month, Freeport McMoran Inc (FCX.N) was the biggest operator to bite the bullet, with plans to close a small U.S. mine and on Monday, Europe's No. 2 copper producer, Poland's KGHM KGH.WA, said it would suspend its McCreedy West copper mine. Combined, they account for less than 50,000 tonnes per year of copper.\n    The last time prices were this low, in 2008, the rout was quick and deep - prices more than halved to under $3,000 per tonne within months of Lehman Brothers going bust in the financial crisis. But it was relatively shortlived after China swooped in to buy copper in large quantities in early 2009, setting a floor under prices and restoring market confidence.\n    \"In 2008, the sentiment was less negative than now because China announced a number of economic measures that inspired confidence in the market,\" said Juan Carlos Guajardo, executive director of Santiago-based mining consulting firm Plusmining.\nGraphic: From Codelco to Glencore, the copper market since 2002: link.reuters.com/xyk65w\nGraphic: Glencore shares vs copper: link.reuters.com/tut55w\n(Additional reporting by Anthony Esposito in Santiago; Editing by Martin Howell)\nNext In Business News\n",

Since then, the Korean won has fallen 10 percent against sterling. According to Richard Clarke, an analyst at stockbroker Sanford C Bernstein, this decline would â€˜have a direct effectâ€™ on the retailerâ€™s sale plans. â€œIf they can get over Â£4 billion itâ€™s a good price,â€� Clarke said.\nTesco will finalise the shortlist of bids for Homeplus today. Media reports suggested last week that private equity firms had formed three separate teams to bid for the unit. Asia-based Affinity Equity Partners has allied with US private equity firm KKR, while Carlyle Group has joined up with Singapore's GIC. Additionally, north Asian-focused MBK partners has sought equity funding from South Korea's National Pension Service to attempt a takeover. A preferred bidder will be chosen next month, while the deal is set for completion by the end of this year.\nIn light of todayâ€™s deadline, a former Tesco director with knowledge of the Asian business warned on Friday that the group may be making a mistake. He said, as quoted by the Daily Mail: â€œKorea is more profitable than the UK â€“ I wouldnâ€™t be selling the crown jewels. I accept Tesco needs to stabilise profits by taking assets out or bringing costs down. But by selling more profitable assets before you have sorted out the core business, you risk putting good money after bad.â€�\nTescoâ€™s share price tumbled amid a widespread stock market decline this morning.

REUTERS/Phil Noble\nBy Ben Hirschler | LONDON\nLONDON AstraZeneca's keenly awaited cancer immunotherapy drug durvalumab may not get to market as quickly as first hoped but the company said on Thursday it was more confident than ever in  its oncology development pipeline.\nThe British drugmaker is running a lung cancer trial known as ATLANTIC that is due to produce results by the end of this year and could, in theory, support a submission seeking accelerated U.S. approval in the first half of 2016.\nHowever, this option is now looking less likely since Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo and Merck's Keytruda have already won U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance in lung cancer, reducing the chances of durvalamb gaining rapid approval.\n\"The landscape has changed because competing products received approval far faster than could have been expected a bit more than a year ago,\" AstraZeneca Chief Executive Pascal Soriot told reporters in a post-results conference call.\nRoche also has a competing product, atezolizumab, that it plans to file for approval in lung cancer in the first quarter of 2016.\nAs a result the chances of an accelerated FDA approval based on ATLANTIC have decreased, since there is a reduced unmet medical need. All four drugs work in a similar way to boost the immune system's ability to detect and fight tumour cells.\nDurvalumab is AstraZeneca's most important pipeline product and the company said last year, during its bid defense against a takeover attempt by Pfizer, that the medicine could eventually generate annual sales of $6.5 billion, making it a key component of an overall $45 billion sales forecast for 2023.\nWhile ATLANTIC is looking at durvalumab's use on its own in a subset of late-stage lung cancer patients, Soriot said the drug's real promise lay in combining it with other products to help a much wider range of patients.\n\"Our long-range forecast for 2023 remains the same. In fact, we now have a little bit more for oncology sales and a little bit less for diabetes in our forecasts,\" he said.\n\"Getting accelerated approval with our monotherapy was never part of our base plan or our long-range forecasts. We still want to pursue the accelerated approval, but as an upside.\"\nSoriot also said AstraZeneca was considering a marketing partnership deal for its gout drug lesinurad, which was recommended for approval by an FDA advisory panel last month.\n\"Partnering the gout portfolio is clearly a very strong option that we are considering,\" he said. \"We have to wait for lesinurad's approval and then, based on that, we will pursue discussions with potential partners.\"\n(Editing by Greg Mahlich)\n",

Tullow warned of the charges last month.\n\"2014 was a difficult year for our industry and a challenging one for Tullow as our results today demonstrate,\" Chief Executive Aidan Heavey said in a statement.\nThe oil price has more than halved in the past six months, hitting the exploration and production sector hard. Unlike the major oil companies BP PLC and Royal Dutch Shell PLC, explorers don't have other parts of their business to fall back on when oil prices are low, such as refining and marketing.\nTullow reported underlying earnings, or loss from continuing operations before tax, of $2.05 billion for last year, below analyst expectations of $1.91 billion. The company reported a pretax profit of $313 million in 2013.\nTullow reported a net loss of $1.55 billion in 2014, compared with a net profit of $169 million in 2013.\nFull-year revenues fell 16% to $2.21 billion, compared with $2.65 billion in 2013, hurt by the oil price decline in the second half of the year and gas-asset sales in Europe and Asia.\nWrite to Selina Williams at selina.williams@wsj.com\nAccess Investor Kit for Tullow Oil Plc\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=GB0001500809\nAccess Investor Kit for Royal Dutch Shell PLC\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=GB00B03MLX29\nAccess Investor Kit for Royal Dutch Shell PLC\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=GB00B03MM408\nAccess Investor Kit for Royal Dutch Shell PLC\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US7802591070\nAccess Investor Kit for Royal Dutch Shell PLC\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US7802592060\nAccess Investor Kit for Tullow Oil Plc\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US8994152028\nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires\nMore from MarketWatch\n",

  "articleText" : "New Issues News | Thu Dec 3, 2015 | 7:55am EST\nUPDATE 3-Barclays sells Italian branches to Mediobanca at a loss\n* CheBanca! to take 89 branches, 620 staff, 2.9 bln euro loans\n* Barclays to book 200 mln pound loss in Q4\n* Barclays could have over 14 bln euro of Italy loans to sell\n* Mediobanca shares up 1.5 pct, Barclays up 0.7 pct   (Adds comments from CEO of CheBanca!)\nBy Silvia Aloisi and Simon Jessop\nMILAN/LONDON, Dec 3 Barclays is paying 237 million euros to sell its branches in Italy to Mediobanca  in a deal that will give the Italian investment bank a boost in a race for asset management fees on its home turf.\nMediobanca said on Thursday its retail division CheBanca! would buy from Barclays 89 branches with 220,000 clients, residential mortgage loans worth 2.9 billion euros ($3.1 billion) and some 550 staff. Reuters reported on Wednesday the deal was imminent.\nThe sale is part of plans by Britain's third biggest bank to shed continental European retail banking operations as it retreats from businesses that are unprofitable or lack scale. Barclays said it would book a 200 million pound ($298.5 million) loss on the transaction in the fourth quarter.\nMilan-based Mediobanca has been seeking to diversify from its core investment-banking business and expand in more stable, less capital-intensive activities at a time when regulators are imposing stricter requirements.\nWith the Barclays deal, CheBanca!, founded in 2008 and focused on digital-savvy customers with between 50,000 and 200,000 euros, will nearly triple its number of branches and its client numbers will grow by 60 percent to 770,000.\nTotal assets under management will double to more than 6 billion euros. The transaction coincides with a move by Italian banks to draw more on the private household cash to make money and offset weak retail operations.\n\"This operation immediately gives us the scale in asset management that we needed and allows us to take a leap forward,\" CheBanca! CEO Gian Luca Sichel told Reuters.\nHe described the 237 million euros CheBanca! is getting from Barclays as a \"dowry\" for restructuring and revamping the network, which he said breaks even.\nHe did not rule out that some branches could be closed in a country where most banks have been cutting their branch networks to reduce costs and are expected to continue to do so.\nBarclays for its part is likely to be left with more than 10 billion pounds, or 14 billion euros, of Italian mortgages on its books, which it is trying to sell. It had 13.5 billion pounds of Italian residential mortgages at the start of the year.\nThe bank has already sold retail operations in Spain and Portugal and is seeking to sell in France.\nOther banks which want to reduce their retail presence in Italy include Deutsche Bank, sources with direct knowledge of the matter said. Deutsche Bank has said any rumours about a withdrawal from the euro zone's third largest economy are unfounded.\nThe Italian sale will reduce Barclays' risk-weighted assets by about 800 million pounds and result in a small decrease in its capital ratio.\nThe deal will have a 20-basis point negative impact on Mediobanca's capital, or around 120 million euros according to analysts, but will boost profit from the 2016-17 financial year.\nBarclays said it would continue to operate investment banking and corporate banking services in Italy, and continue to manage its remaining retail mortgage portfolio. It is attempting to parcel those loans up and sell them to investors, including private equity firms.\n($1 = 0.9448 euros)\n(Additional reporting by Steve Slater, Paola Arosio; Editing by Mark Potter and Jane Merriman)\nNext In New Issues News\n",

  "articleText" : "Diageo Shares Surge on Report of Possible Takeover by Lemann\nPaul Jarvis\nJune 8, 2015 — 3:14 AM EDT\nUpdated on\nShare on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp\nDiageo Plc, the maker of Guinness stout and Johnnie Walker whisky, surged in London trading on a report that a billionaire backer of Anheuser-Busch InBev NV is considering a takeover bid.\nJorge Paulo Lemann and other executives are in early stages of mulling an acquisition, according to a column on Friday by Lauro Jardim, an influential writer for Veja, Brazil’s biggest-selling news magazine. A spokeswoman in Brazil for Lemann declined to comment, as did a representative for London-based Diageo.\nDiageo shares rose as much as 8.7 percent to 1,914 pence, the steepest intraday gain since November 2008, boosting the company’s market value to about 48 billion pounds ($73 billion). They were up 6.8 percent as of 10:31 a.m.\nVeja’s report fueled renewed speculation of takeover activity in an industry where consolidation has been rife. Deals worth about $66 billion have been completed in the last three years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Diageo has played its part in that, last year gaining control of India’s United Spirits Ltd. after a $1.9 billion tender offer.\nMost analysts remain skeptical that Diageo will be bought.\nA leveraged buyout of the distiller “would be a huge stretch,” analysts at Jefferies said in a note Monday. Lemann’s 3G Capital would need to raise about 48 billion pounds, more than double the equity component of the biggest leveraged buyout in history, TXU Corp. in 2007, they said.\nDiageo’s current price-to-earnings ratio and the bid premium that would be required also mean it’s unclear how attractive the financial returns would be, Jefferies said. The shares trade on a multiple of about 24 times earnings for the past year.\n3G Transactions\n3G Capital has used a series of transactions to expand its stable of household names -- often working with Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. The private-equity firm orchestrated a deal last year to combine Burger King Worldwide Inc. with Tim Hortons Inc., a coffee-and-doughnut chain. It previously teamed up with Berkshire to acquire H.J. Heinz and is now merging that company with Kraft Foods Group Inc.\nThe challenges of monitoring the Heinz-Kraft deal mean the chances of a takeover of Diageo in the near-term “seem slim,” analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein said in a note Monday.\nLemann and his partners also have profited from consolidation in the alcoholic beverage industry. They combined Latin American brewers, then engineered an $11 billion merger with Belgium’s Interbrew NV in 2004. In 2008, they led the $52 billion union with Anheuser-Busch Cos. to form AB InBev, the world’s largest beer maker.\nBuffett didn’t immediately return a message seeking comment left with an assistant.\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

REUTERS/Stephen Hird\nBy Carolyn Cohn and Matt Scuffham | LONDON\nLONDON Insurers Aviva Plc (AV.L) and Friends Life Group Plc FLG.L reported forecast-beating yearly profits on Thursday, lifting their shares to multi-year highs ahead of a 5.6 billion pound agreed merger due to complete next month.\nAviva is acquiring Friends Life as changes in the UK pensions market put pressure on life insurance companies, leading to a drop in their sales of income-bearing annuities.\nThe deal is expected to bring 225 million pounds in annual savings, Aviva reiterated on Thursday, and material capital savings, without giving further detail.\nAviva Chief Executive Mark Wilson, appointed two years ago from Asian rival AIA (1299.HK) with the task of restructuring the company, told reporters: \"The proposed acquisition of Friends Life accelerates our turnaround and our ability to deliver our investment thesis.\"\nAviva reported a 6 percent rise in operating profit to 2.17 billion pounds, a touch higher than forecasts of 2.15 billion in a company-supplied poll. Friends Life's operating profit jumped 38 percent to 556 million, beating forecasts of 352 million in its company poll.\nAviva shares hit their highest since Sept 2008 and were trading at 557.5 pence at 0850 GMT, up 4.6 percent. Friends rose to April 2009 highs and were trading at 424p, also up 4.6 percent and an 8 percent premium to their close on Nov. 20, when the two announced merger plans.\n\"Aviva's results represent a small beat compared to consensus on pretty much every key metric,\" said Barrie Cornes, analyst at Panmure Gordon in a client note, reiterating his \"buy\" recommendation.\nPENSION CHANGES\nHolders of Friends stock will receive 0.74 new Aviva shares for each Friends share. Investors, who vote on the merger on March 26, have said the deal makes sense as a way to cope with UK pension changes.\nThe reforms, to be implemented next month, allow retirees to use their pension pots as they choose, rather than forcing them to buy an income-bearing annuity.\nAviva said the value of new business for its UK annuity business fell 16 percent, as bulk annuity sales, or taking on the risk of company final-salary pensions, failed to outweigh a drop in individual annuity sales.\nFriends also reported a 15 percent drop in annuity sales.\nAviva's fund management arm is looking to an increase of up to 70 billion pounds in funds under management with the Friends acquisition, boosting total funds under management above 300 billion.\nThe company said a 16 percent rise in Aviva Investors' operating profit \"remains inadequate\". It signed a deal in January with Virtus Investment Partners in the United States, which Wilson said would help distribution.\nIn emerging markets, Wilson said Aviva was considering options for its Indian joint venture with Dabur Group following a rule change increasing foreign investment limits. Options could include selling the business, Wilson said.\nAviva will pay a final dividend of 12.25p per share, up 30 percent, making a total of 18.1p. Friends will pay a total 31.15p, subject to completion of the merger.\n(Editing by Sinead Cruise and David Holmes)\nNext In Business News\n",

  "articleText" : "Funds News | Mon Aug 10, 2015 | 2:35pm EDT\nUPDATE 5-Buffett pays high price for Precision Castparts\n(Adds comments, details on valuation, updates share prices)\nBy Jonathan Stempel, Sagarika Jaisinghani and Sweta Singh\nAug 10 Warren Buffett is paying a hefty price for the biggest bet of his career as his Berkshire Hathaway Inc  has agreed to buy Precision Castparts Corp, valuing the maker of aerospace and other parts at $32.3 billion.\nThe purchase is Berkshire's largest, and accelerates its transformation from a company largely dependent on insurance businesses into one resembling the broader U.S. economy, including a railroad, several industrial companies, utilities, a car dealership and consumer goods businesses.\nIt also joins several recent Buffett forays into unglamorous sectors, including a big stake Kraft Heinz Co and the pending takeover of the Duracell battery business from Procter & Gamble Co.\nBerkshire has said it owned 3 percent of Precision Castparts prior to Monday's takeover. Precision Castparts earned $1.53 billion in its latest fiscal year.\n\"I'm not crazy about paying $30 billion for a $1.5 billion earnings stream of a cyclical company supplying airplane makers,\" said Jeff Matthews, a principal at hedge fund Ram Partners and author of a book about Buffett. \"I'd keep the $30 billion and wait for the next crisis.\"\nKnown for buying undervalued and often unloved companies, Buffett acknowledged paying a steep price for Precision Castparts, which has been hurt by falling oil and gas prices.\n\"This is a very high multiple for us to pay,\" he told CNBC television.\nBerkshire is paying $235 per share for Precision Castparts, which represents a 21.2 percent premium over Friday's closing price, and 17.5 times projected 12-month profit. It valued Precision Castparts at $37.2 billion including debt.\nThe merger eclipses Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire's $26.5 billion purchase in 2010 of the 77.4 percent of the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad that it did not already own.\nIn afternoon trading, Precision Castparts shares rose $37.13, or 19.2 percent, to $231.01. Berkshire's Class A shares fell $522.76, or 0.2 percent, to $214,940.\n'CREDIT TO TODD COMBS'\nThe latest purchase shows how hard it is to move the needle at Berkshire, whose own stock has lagged the Standard & Poor's 500 in the last five years and which on Friday posted quarterly operating profit well below analyst forecasts.\nAdding Precision Castparts would boost Berkshire's overall operating profit by less than 10 percent.\nIt would also give Berkshire ownership of 10 companies that standing alone could be part of the Fortune 500, plus 26.9 percent of Kraft Heinz.\nTodd Combs, one of Buffett's investment managers, had begun buying Precision Castparts shares in 2012.\n\"You've got to give credit to Todd Combs for this deal,\" said Buffett, who turns 85 on August 30. Buffett has run Berkshire since 1965.\nPrecision Castparts generates 70 percent of sales by making nuts, bolts and other fittings for the aerospace industry, where booming commercial aircraft demand has led Airbus Group SE  and Boeing Co to boost production.\nBut the Portland, Oregon-based company also makes parts for the energy industry, which has struggled as oil prices   have fallen by more than half over the last year.\nPrior to Monday, Precision Castparts' shares had fallen 20 percent in 2015, and the purchase price is below the shares' 52-week high of $249.05 set last September.\nEven so, analysts said Berkshire is paying more than 12 times trailing earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. That's above the 9 multiple for BNSF, which now generates more than one-fifth of Berkshire's operating profit.\n\"At the time of his Burlington Northern deal, everyone criticized he paid too high a price,\" said Ken Shubin Stein, founder of Spencer Capital Management in New York.\nMORE DEALMAKING?\nPrecision Castparts would become a unit of Berkshire, keeping its name and management as well as its headquarters.\n\"We see a unique alignment between Warren's management and investment philosophy and how we manage PCC for the long term,\" Chief Executive Mark Donegan said in a statement.\nAndrew Carolus, managing director at Mesirow Financial Investment Banking in Chicago, said Buffett is \"obviously a believer\" in Precision Castparts' prospects \"over the next five to six decades.\"\nBrian Reynolds, chief market strategist at New Albion Partners in New York, added that having access to Berkshire's balance sheet could help Precision Castparts do more dealmaking, \"which the management has proven they're good at.\"\nOther industrial companies that Buffett has bought in the last decade include toolmaker Iscar, parts maker Marmon, and specialty chemicals company Lubrizol.\nBuffett said Berkshire would spend $23 billion of cash to finance the Precision Castparts purchase, and borrow the rest.\nWhile that would leave Berkshire with more than $40 billion of cash, twice the cushion Buffett wants, Buffett said it would be at least a year before he could pursue another \"elephant\" sized transaction.\nKraft Heinz has proven among his most successful. Buffett has in two years transformed what he has called a $9.5 billion investment in the former H.J. Heinz Co into a Kraft Heinz stake worth roughly $25.5 billion.\nThe Castparts merger is expected to close in the first quarter of 2016. Credit Suisse and the law firms Cravath, Swaine & Moore and Stoel Rives advised Precision Castparts. The law firm Munger, Tolles & Olson advised Berkshire.

In this environment, given our prospects and our outlook, Shire's offer is not compelling.\"\nIf Shire were to sweeten the offer, however, it might be open to negotiations, said one person familiar with the U.S. company.\nShare price fluctuations since Aug. 3 mean Shire's offer is currently worth around $42.50.\n($1 = 0.9139 euros)   (Additional reporting by Nishant Kumar and Greg Roumeliotis; Editing by Jane Merriman)\nNext In Hot Stocks\n",

  "articleText" : "Top News | Tue Feb 23, 2016 | 9:33am EST\nBHP Billiton slashes dividend, posts $5.67 billion net loss\nBy James Regan | SYDNEY\nSYDNEY Top global miner BHP Billiton (BHP.AX) (BLT.L) slashed its interim dividend by 75 percent on Tuesday, abandoning a long-held policy of steady or higher payouts as it braces for a longer-than-expected commodities downturn.\nThe end to BHP's so-called progressive dividend policy came as the world's biggest diversified miner slumped to a net loss of $5.67 billion for the six months to Dec. 31, its first loss in more than 16 years.\n\"We need to recognize we are in a new era, a new world and we need a different dividend policy to handle that,\" Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie said on a media call, warning of a prolonged period of weaker prices and higher volatility.\nThe dividend cut to 16 cents was more severe than market expectations for a payout as high as 35 cents. BHP pledged a minimum 50 percent payout of underlying profit going forward.\n\"Given months of anguish and market debate regarding the dividend, we expect that 16 cents while disappointing, is a cash flow positive and therefore will likely be absorbed by the market,\" said Shaw and Partners analyst Peter O'Connor.\nMackenzie said the shift was part of a broader strategy to help BHP Billiton manage volatility.\n\"The financial flexibility we will gain as a company from this move ... will allow us to invest counter cyclically,\" he said. \"It will allow us to look at tier one assets in distress.\"\nStandard & Poor's cut BHP's credit rating to 'A' from 'A+' this month and warned it might downgrade again if the company failed to take more steps to preserve cash and review its dividend policy.\n\"I can't see (the ratings agencies) downgrading. They probably would have if the commodity outlook was still poor, but I think the outlook is starting to turn in BHP's favor,\" said Fat Prophets mining analyst David Lennox.\nMackenzie also announced a revamp of BHP's corporate structure in a bid to simplify operations, creating U.S. and Australian mineral divisions in a move that will see its iron ore chief Jimmy Wilson and petroleum head Tim Cutt depart.\nBHP shares rose 2.5 percent to $17.62 by early afternoon in a slightly weaker overall market.\nAustralian Shareholders Association director Geoffrey Bowd said the dividend cut was \"very prudent\" in light of the commodities outlook.\nShares in close peer Rio Tinto (RIO.AX) (RIO.L) have risen some 9 percent since it swapped its progressive dividend policy for a payout ratio on Feb. 11.\nPROFIT MISS\nUnderlying attributable profit plunged to $412 million from $4.89 billion a year earlier, missing analysts' forecasts for around $585 million, as commodities prices plummeted to multi-year lows.\n\"While the miss looks big in percentage terms, the numbers are quite frankly disappointingly low anyway,\" said Shaw's O'Connor, pointing to BHP's $100 billion asset base.\nDespite the tough outlook, Mackenzie said BHP was still generating EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margins of 40 percent, which is ahead of the reported figure of around 34 percent for Rio Tinto.\nAt today's spot prices, the company would expect to generate  $10 billion in operating cash flow for the year, he said.\nBHP's results included an after tax charge of $858 million following a dam disaster in Brazil at its Samarco joint venture with Vale (VALE5.SA), which killed 17 people in that country's worst environmental disaster.\nA total of $6.1 billion of exceptional items included an impairment charge of $4.9 billion against the carrying value of its U.S. onshore oil and gas assets and $390 million for global taxation matters\nMackenzie said there were no immediate plans to expand shale operations in the United States, but BHP remained committed to the business.\n(Reporting by James Regan; Additional reporting by Melanie Burton; Editing by Richard Pullin)\nA logo for mining company BHP Billiton adorns a sign outside the Perth Convention Centre where their annual general meeting was being held in Perth, Western Australia, in this November 19, 2015 file photo.

Breo, a successor to Advair, exceeded estimates by 35 percent, with sales of 38 million pounds.\nGlaxo’s stock rose 1.6 percent to 1,476 pence at the close of trading in London. That extended the advance this year to 7.3 percent.\nWhile sales of Advair will continue to decline, Witty said Glaxo’s combination of new respiratory drugs, including Breo, Anoro and Incruse, will probably exceed Advair’s peak sales, in 2013, of 5.3 billion pounds. Advair loses patent protection in the U.S. in 2016.\n“Advair is not going to be the be-all and end-all of the GSK story, as it has been driving things for the past 10 years,” he said.\nEarnings Exceed\nThe positive signs on respiratory medicine came as Glaxo’s profit excluding certain items fell 9 percent from a year earlier to 1.77 billion pounds, or 27.3 pence a share, the London-based company said in a statement. Analysts expected 26.5 pence a share, the average of 12 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\nGlaxo’s revenue from HIV treatments climbed 25 percent as sales of two new drugs exceeded the company’s expectations. Oncology sales in the U.S. rose 45 percent, led by Votrient for tumors of the kidney and soft tissue, and Promacta for blood disorders. The company also benefited from a lower tax rate.\nGlaxo’s total revenue for the quarter was 6.19 billion pounds, beating the average estimate.\nGlaxo’s results suggest the company may have put the worst behind it, said Mick Cooper, an analyst at Edison Investment Research.\n“These results highlight how 2014 has been a tough year,” Cooper said in a note. “This year should be better in many ways, with the respiratory franchise returning to growth, the visibility on the positive impacts of the complex Novartis deals improving, as well as looking forward to more of the value inherent in the ViiV shareholding being realized.”\nLast year, Novartis AS agreed to buy Glaxo’s cancer drugs business for as much as $16 billion while selling most of its own vaccines division to Glaxo for as much as $7.1 billion. Glaxo and Novartis will also form a joint venture to sell consumer health products.\nThe company last year announced it would explore spinning off a portion of its stake in ViiV, an HIV-drug unit created in 2009. The unit is a joint venture with Pfizer Inc. and Shionogi & Co.\nWitty said he is open to considering possible spinoffs of the new vaccines and consumer health business as well.\n“I don’t have a religious commitment to any particular kind of corporate structure,” he said. “If there are alternative approaches which can meet those objectives in a better way, then we should always be open-minded to those.”\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

  "articleText" : "Thursday 30 June 2016 10:39 BST\nCheerleader: Barclays chief executive Jes Staley Debra Hurford Brown/Barclays/PA\nAn American is emerging as the biggest post-Brexit cheerleader for the City we’ve got.\nJes Staley, the tough-guy Wall Streeter now running Barclays, will tonight pour scorn on the idea of moving bank staff to the EU following the Leave vote.\nSources say that rather than scaremongering and hand-wringing like some rivals, he’ll come out swinging for Britain in the TV studios. \nEurope’s banks, he believes, are so weakened these days that it’s Barclays’ job, in London, to be the region’s champion. Who else will counter the US players rapidly cornering markets where capital-constrained European banks these days fear to tread, he’ll ask.\nStaley says this is a political, not a financial, crisis. Banks, he believes, are so much stronger than in 2008 that they will serve as a stabiliser to the economy, rather than a threat. \nUK deficit crisis heightens fears of Brexit impact\nIt promises to be heartening stuff and, frankly, it’s about time we heard some positivity from our biggest bosses. \nGet Staley chatting about the crisis days of Lehman Brothers and he talks in awe about the leadership of his boss at the time, JPMorgan chief Jamie Dimon. \nThere’s a long way to go before flabby Barclays gets into JP’s shape, but today’s fighting talk suggests Staley learned a thing or two at his master’s elbow.\nMore about:\n",

AstraZeneca stock fell 0.8 percent.\nThe agreement covers Diprivan, used for general anesthesia, EMLA, a topical anesthetic, and five local anesthetics. The anesthetics, which are sold in more than a hundred countries, had sales in 2015 of $592 million.\nAstraZeneca will continue to manufacture and supply the products on a cost plus basis to Aspen for an initial 10 years.\nAstraZeneca has used externalization income from licensing out products in non-core areas, such as neuroscience, to help fund investment in new medicines in cancer and other fields.\nExternalization has helped underpin AstraZeneca's profits at a time it is facing a raft of patent expiries on previous blockbuster drugs, such as cholesterol fighter Crestor and heartburn medicine Nexium, but it has led to criticism about the quality of earnings from some analysts.\nExternalization deals contributed $1.1 billion to revenue last year and the company has said the figure will be higher in 2016.\n(Additional reporting by Paul Sandle; editing by David Clarke)\nNext In Business News\n",

It has now run up 41% since closing at a 2 1/2-year low of $973.80 on Feb. 8, 2016.\nAnalyst Christopher Merwin raised his rating to overweight from equal weight, where it stood for the past year. He boosted his stock price target by 15% to $1,500 from $1,300. The target is 2.1% above the Nov. 14, 2015, record close of $1,469.56. And it’s nearly 10% above current levels.\n“We believe there is a valuation disconnect from concerns that are either timing related or mostly played out,” Merwin wrote in a note to clients.\nThe concerns over the current quarter stem from the downbeat earnings outlook Priceline issued in May when it reported first-quarter results. Merwin said he believes the disappointing outlook, which reflected the timing of Easter, the European soccer tournament and the Ramadan holiday, will have “a corresponding benefit” to the third quarter. That means there will be little impact on full-year results.\nBesides, Priceline has made a habit of lowering investor expectations so they can be exceeded. The company has beat earnings expectations for at least 25 straight quarters, based on available FactSet data.\nPriceline could be “purposefully setting a low bar” for the second quarter, Merwin said, “such that interim CEO Jeff Boyd and the rest of the management team can demonstrate strong execution following the recent departure of former CEO Darren Huston.”\nThe stock had plunged 7.5% on May 4 following Priceline’s downbeat profit outlook, but it has run up 9.3% since then.\nFactSet\nAs for take rate and margin concerns, Merwin believes take rates have already started stabilizing and margins should begin improving as the company shifts to marketing channels, like Facebook Inc. FB, -0.38% with higher return on investments, than current channels such as Alphabet Inc.’s GOOGL, +0.16%  Google.\nFinally, Merwin believes recent growth in alternative accommodations, such as the rapid rise of Airbnb Inc., is a benefit to Priceline rather than a threat.\nHe wrote, “the emergence of a new end-market and resulting fragmentation of inventory supply actually improves Priceline’s standing in the value chain, as an aggregator of all types of hotel/alternative accommodation inventory with maximum choice and transparency for cost-conscious consumers.”\nMore from MarketWatch\n",

Marks & Spencer PLC finished among the session’s few decliners.\nThe FTSE 100 UKX, +0.17%  surged 2.3% to 6,526.41, the strongest rise since Dec. 16, according to FactSet data, with only five companies trading lower. The shares were pushed to session highs as European stocks SXXP, +0.18%   were driven higher on the prospect of further monetary stimulus in the eurozone.\nStocks held to gains after the Bank of England kept its key lending rate at a record low of 0.5% and left the size of its bond-buying program at 375 billion pounds ($567 billion), as expected. The pound GBPUSD, +0.2088% had been little changed against the dollar after the announcement, but later gained some ground to trade at $1.5109 versus $1.511 on Wednesday.\nTopping the FTSE 100 was Tesco TSCO, +0.33% whose stock shot up 15% in heavy volume, and closed above £2 for the first time since late September. The supermarket chain said it plans to close 43 unprofitable stores, sell off assets and cut prices as well as not pay a final dividend. Same-store sales, excluding gasoline, fell 2.9% in the 19 weeks to Jan. 3, a narrower-than-expected decline. The decline was an improvement from a 5.4% fall in the second quarter.\n“Tesco had a good Christmas” but that may not mark the start of a long-term turnaround in sales, wrote Louise Cooper, analyst at Cooper City, in a report Thursday. “The competitive pressures remain intense. It is interesting that Britons clearly were happy to spend more at Tesco over the special period that is Christmas. But now that the festive period is over, I think they will return to their price-conscious ways.”\nInvestors also pushed up shares of rival supermarket chain J Sainsbury SBRY, +0.00% and Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC MRW, +0.27%  by 10% and 8%, respectively.\nShares of Talk Talk Telecom Group PLC TALK, +0.39%  rose 0.5% after the company said it purchased Tesco’s Blinkbox video-on-demand business for 5 million pounds ($7.6 million).\nBut holding at the bottom of the FTSE 100 was Marks & Spencer MKS, -0.24% Its shares fell 3.3% after the high-street retailer posted a fall in sales for the key Christmas period , stemming mainly from the general-merchandise portion of its business.

Former chief financial officer Howard Schiller and his successor, Robert Rosiello, could be candidates, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier Tuesday, citing people familiar with the situation.\nValeant shares dropped 6.8 per cent to $94 in late trading. Through Tuesday’s close, they had fallen 12 per cent since Pearson’s hospitalization was disclosed on Christmas Day.\nThe drugmaker announced that Pearson was taking a medical leave of absence starting on Dec. 28 and that the company would be run by a team of three executives, including general counsel Robert Chai-Onn, executive vice-president Ari Kellen and CFO Rosiello. Valeant board members Schiller, Robert Ingram and Mason Morfit were tapped to oversee the executives.\nPneumonia is an infection of the lungs caused by bacteria, a virus or fungi, with symptoms including cough, fever and difficulty breathing. With treatment, most patients improve within one to three weeks, according to the American Lung Association. About 53,000 people in the U.S. died of it in 2013, said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nPearson’s illness has threatened to hamper the company’s recent efforts to win back investors’ trust. In December, the 56-year-old executive urged investors to look past concerns that have sent the stock of the Laval-based company down more than 50 per cent from its August peak, saying they should focus on products that will grow beyond expectations.\nPearson has promised shareholders to provide more transparent data about Valeant’s business, including sales figures for its top 30 drugs. The company’s strategy has drawn scrutiny from lawmakers and investors for its use of mail-order pharmacies, price increases and acquisitions for growth.\nTo rebuild, Pearson reached a deal in December with Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. to sell Valeant drugs in the drugstore chain’s pharmacies, replacing an arrangement with a controversial mail-order pharmacy called Philidor Rx Services.\n",

  "articleText" : "Output from underground site in Mongolia will begin in 2020\nLong-term outlook is strong for copper, Rio deputy CEO says\nShare on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp\nRio Tinto Group and its partners approved a $5.3 billion expansion to more than double output at the Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold mine in Mongolia as producers race to meet a forecast global deficit by the end of the decade.\nWork on the project will begin from the middle of this year and first production from the underground mine is expected in 2020, London-based Rio, the world’s-second biggest mining company, said Friday in a statement. When the underground is fully ramped up in 2027, Oyu Tolgoi is expected to produce more than 500,000 metric tons of copper a year.\nShares of Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd., which owns 66 percent of the deposit, jumped 8.7 percent to C$3.74 at 11:46 a.m. in Toronto, after earlier climbing as much as 13 percent, the biggest intraday increase since February. Rio Tinto controls Turquoise Hill through a 51 percent equity stake, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nAs the big miners look to a rebound in commodities, Rio and rival BHP Billiton Ltd. have identified copper as a key focus for growth, flagging the metal as a priority by examining potential deals and allocating project spending. On Friday, OZ Minerals Ltd. unveiled a revised A$975 million ($718 million) plan to begin output from Australia’s biggest undeveloped copper deposit by 2019.\n“Long-term copper fundamentals remain strong,” Jean-Sebastien Jacques, Rio’s deputy chief executive officer, said in the statement. “Production from the Oyu Tolgoi underground will commence at a time when copper markets are expected to face a structural deficit.” Jacques will become CEO in July, replacing Sam Walsh.\nOyu Tolgoi, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) north of the Chinese border, will rank as the third-largest in the world at full production, according to Wood Mackenzie Ltd. The site is forecast to produce 175,000 tons to 195,000 tons of copper in concentrate in 2016.\nA rising number of middle-class consumers in emerging markets will boost copper demand as they add appliances containing the metal, Gavin Wendt, Sydney-based founding director at MineLife Pty, said by phone before the announcement. China will need an extra\n15 million tons by 2025 just for wiring in its expanded power grid, Rio said last year.\nA shortfall of the metal should emerge later this decade, according to Rio’s Jacques, while Freeport-McMoRan Inc., the largest publicly traded copper producer, sees the market in deficit\nas soon as next year . Jacques, who won promotion after\nnegotiating the financing of the Oyu Tolgoi upgrade with a group of 20 lenders, sees the metal as central to Rio’s growth. “We will see a new metals age, with copper at the center,” he told a Bloomberg event in London in October.\nBHP is studying a $2.2 billion option to expand its Spence operation in Chile to extend its life by about 50 years, while the Melbourne-based producer and Rio are progressing the approvals process for their Resolution joint copper venture in Arizona. BHP CEO Andrew Mackenzie sees “significant upside” in copper as demand outpaces declining supply.\nGrasberg Venture\nRio’s expansion in Mongolia, together with growth at operations including the Grasberg joint venture in Indonesia, will double the producer’s total annual copper output to about 1.1 million tons over the next decade, according to Deutsche Bank AG. Rio, the world’s seventh-largest copper producer in 2015, got 11 percent of earnings from the metal last year, compared with almost 60 percent from iron ore.\nProgress on Oyu Tolgoi’s underground extension, where about 80 percent of the deposit’s mineral wealth is located, stalled in mid-2013 amid disagreements over taxes and cost overruns that were resolved last May. A\n$4.4 billion financing package with lenders including the Export-Import Bank of the United States, BNP Paribas SA and Standard Chartered Plc was finalized in December. The project’s cost compares with an\nestimate in December of between $5 billion and $6 billion.\nThe parties have agreed a senior debt cap of $6 billion, providing the option for $1.6 billion of supplemental senior debt.\nMongolia’s state-owned Erdenes Oyu Tolgoi LLC holds the share of the mine not owned by Turquoise Hill.\n(A previous version of this story corrected a misspelling in the first deck headline.)\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

  "articleText" : "ViiV Healthcare and Desano Pharmaceuticals’ manufacturing agreement will allow competitive supply of dolutegravir in China and several developing countries\nAgreement reinforces ViiV Healthcare commitment to improving access to HIV treatments\nLondon, UK, 2 July 2015 – ViiV Healthcare and Desano Pharmaceuticals (Desano) today announced a strategic manufacturing agreement to enable production in China of dolutegravir. The agreement will offer an additional source of the dolutegravir active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), and will allow ViiV Healthcare to offer a competitive supply of the finished product (dolutegravir 50mg, marketed under the name Tivicay®) for China and a number of developing countries, subject to national approvals. This strengthens ViiV Healthcare’s commitment to improve access to its treatments for people living with HIV, especially in countries hardest hit by the disease.\n“This manufacturing agreement with Desano for dolutegravir is a significant achievement to facilitate access to our medicines. With our recent agreement with the Medicines Patent Pool and our other access initiatives this deal is aligned with our ongoing commitment to improve access to our medicines in countries where the need is greatest.” said Dr Dominique Limet, Chief Executive Officer, ViiV Healthcare.\nBased in Shanghai, Desano is a high quality manufacturer, therefore well suited to partner with ViiV\nHealthcare. Under the agreement, Desano will manufacture the API of dolutegravir to feed in to the GSK/ViiV Healthcare supply chain for onward sale in China and developing countries covered by the agreement. ViiV Healthcare and Desano are also exploring further options for future manufacture of finished drug product and fixed dose combinations of dolutegravir with APIs.  \n“As one of the leading Chinese pharmaceutical companies dedicated to developing, manufacturing and supplying antiretroviral (ARV) APIs for HIV and finished pharmaceutical products, Desano is honored to cooperate with ViiV Healthcare to manufacture a high quality, competitive supply of dolutegravir and its combinations,” said Ying Kan, President of Desano Pharmaceuticals. “We believe that working together with ViiV Healthcare we can better contribute to the global goal of making treatment options available to patients across the globe.”\nAbout dolutegravir (Tivicay)\nDolutegravir is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) for use in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV. Integrase inhibitors block HIV replication by preventing the viral DNA from integrating into the genetic material of human immune cells (T-cells). This step is essential in the HIV replication cycle and is also responsible for establishing chronic infection.\nTivicay is approved in over 70 countries across North America, Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa and Latin America. A regulatory application for dolutegravir is currently being evaluated by the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA).\nAbout Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in China\nUNAIDS estimates that approximately 780,000 (620,000 to 940,000) people are infected with HIV/AIDS in China.  With more than 40,000 new HIV infections and over 25,000 deaths reported in 2011.1 People living with HIV/ AIDS in China who meet the national treatment criteria are referred to receive care through the China National Free Antiretroviral Treatment Programme (CNFATP).2 Still, only an estimated 126,000 people with HIV were receiving antiretroviral treatment, with an estimated 76% of adults and children who met the criteria receiving antiretroviral treatment.1\nAbout ViiV Healthcare\nViiV Healthcare is a global specialist HIV company established in November 2009 by GlaxoSmithKline (LSE: GSK) and Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) dedicated to delivering advances in treatment and care for people living with HIV. Shionogi joined in October 2012. The company’s aim is to take a deeper and broader interest in HIV/AIDS than any company has done before and take a new approach to deliver effective and new HIV medicines, as well as support communities affected by HIV. For more information on the company, its management, portfolio, pipeline, and commitment, please visit  www.viivhealthcare.com\nAbout Desano Pharmaceuticals\nFounded in 1996, Desano Pharmaceutical is a leading vertically integrated pharmaceuticals company specialising in developing and manufacturing of generic ARV APIs and formulations with 4 manufacturing sites located in China approved by the agencies of CFDA, USFDA and WHO. Desano Pharmaceutical is one of the key ARV APIs suppliers for low to middle income countries, supporting over 4 million AIDS patients treatment. For more information, please visit www.desano.com\nImportant Information about Tivicay® (dolutegravir)\nFDA Indication and Usage:  TIVICAY is a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV-1 infection.\nUse of TIVICAY in INSTI-experienced patients should be guided by the number and type of baseline INSTI substitutions.  The efficacy of TIVICAY 50 mg twice daily is reduced in patients with an INSTI-resistance Q148 substitution plus 2 or more additional INSTI-resistance substitutions including T66A, L74I/M, E138A/K/T, G140S/A/C, Y143R/C/H, E157Q, G163S/E/K/Q, or G193E/R.\nImportant Safety Information for Tivicay® (dolutegravir)\nContraindication: TIVICAY is contraindicated (1) in patients with previous hypersensitivity reaction to dolutegravir, and (2) in patients receiving dofetilide (antiarrhythmic) due to the potential for increased dofetilide plasma concentrations and the risk for serious and/or life-threatening events. \nHypersensitivity Reactions: Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported and were characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and sometimes organ dysfunction, including liver injury. The events were reported in 1% or fewer subjects receiving TIVICAY in Phase 3 clinical trials. Discontinue TIVICAY and other suspect agents immediately if signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reaction develop, (including but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters or peeling of the skin, oral blisters or lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, hepatitis, eosinophilia, angioedema, difficulty breathing.) Monitor clinical status, including liver aminotransferases, and initiate appropriate therapy. Delay in stopping treatment with TIVICAY or other suspect agents after the onset of hypersensitivity may result in a life-threatening reaction. TIVICAY is contraindicated in patients who have experienced a hypersensitivity reaction to dolutegravir.\nEffects on Serum Liver Biochemistries in Patients with Hepatitis B or C Coinfection: Patients with underlying hepatitis B or C may be at increased risk for worsening or development of transaminase elevations with use of TIVICAY. In some cases the elevations in transaminases were consistent with immune reconstitution syndrome or hepatitis B reactivation particularly in the setting where anti-hepatitis therapy was withdrawn. Appropriate laboratory testing prior to initiating therapy and monitoring for hepatotoxicity during therapy with TIVICAY are recommended in patients with underlying hepatic disease such as hepatitis B or C. \nFat Redistribution: Redistribution/accumulation of body fat has been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy.\nImmune Reconstitution Syndrome: During the initial phase of treatment, immune reconstitution syndrome can occur, which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders have been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; the time to onset is more variable and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.\nAdverse Reactions: The most commonly reported (≥2%) adverse reactions of moderate to severe intensity in treatment naïve adult subjects in any one trial receiving TIVICAY in a combination regimen were insomnia (3%), fatigue (2%), and headache (2%). \nDrug Interactions: Co-administration of TIVICAY with drugs that are strong inducers of UGT1A1 and/or CYP3A4 may result in reduced plasma concentrations of dolutegravir and require dose adjustments of TIVICAY.\n- TIVICAY should be taken2 hours before or 6 hours after taking cation-containing antacids or laxatives, sucralfate, oral iron supplements, oral calcium supplements, or buffered medications.\n- Consult the full Prescribing Information for TIVICAY for more information on potentially significant drug interactions, including clinical comments.\nPregnancy: Pregnancy category B. TIVICAY should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk. An Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry has been established.\nBreastfeeding: Breastfeeding is NOT recommended due to the potential for HIV transmission and the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants.\nPaediatric Patients: Safety and efficacy of TIVICAY has not been established in children younger than 12 years old, or weighing <40 kg, or in INSTI-experienced paediatric patients with documented or clinically suspected INSTI resistance.\nPlease visit the following link for the full US prescribing and patient information: https://www.viivhealthcare.com/media/58599/us_tivicay.pdf .  \nTivicay is a registered trademark of the ViiV Healthcare group of companies.\n \n",

REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo\nBy Ben Hirschler | LONDON\nLONDON Improving margins and growing demand for new drugs lifted GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK.L) underlying earnings a better-than-expected 14 percent in the first quarter, keeping it on course to achieve a promised return to growth in 2016.\nThe results help vindicate the claims of outgoing Chief Executive Andrew Witty that the British drugmaker is on the road to recovery, with demand for new respiratory and HIV medicines offsetting a decline in sales of aging lung treatment Advair.\nWitty, who bows out in March next year, told reporters he expected a successor to be named towards the end of 2016. Both internal and external candidates are being considered and the choice of new CEO is seen signaling GSK's future direction.\nWitty has been under pressure over the last three years as profits have flagged and some investors have questioned his focus on consumer health products, which range from headache pills to toothpaste, leading to calls for a break-up of GSK.\nBut Wednesday's results suggest GSK is delivering on a pledge to stabilize its core pharmaceuticals business and boost profitability in its non-prescription operation, which was recently expanded through a $20 billion three-way asset swap with Novartis (NOVN.S).\n\"A rebound has started, if measured from the rather deep hole that had been dug,\" said Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson, who rates the shares market-perform.\nConsumer profit margins jumped to 17 percent, from 12 percent in the previous three months, and Witty said the company could well achieve its target of 20 percent or more ahead of its current 2020 goal.\nVaccines also did well, helped by some early orders from governments, while Witty predicted the core respiratory medicine business, where GSK is market leader, would grow this year, driven by new drugs like Breo, Anoro and Nucala.\n\"This puts us on the right track to achieve the expectations we set out last year, although inevitably, we expect some quarter-to-quarter volatility in reported progress, particularly in our margins, given the dynamics of our businesses,\" Witty said.\nSales, in sterling terms, rose 11 percent to 6.23 billion pounds ($9.10 billion) in the three months to March, generating core earnings per share (EPS) of 19.8 pence, helped by a weaker pound.\nAnalysts, on average, had forecast sales of 6.01 billion pounds and core EPS, which excludes certain items, of 17.9p, according to Thomson Reuters.\nGSK said it expected 10 to 12 percent growth in 2016 core EPS at constant currencies and confirmed that the dividend, one of the stock's main attractions with a yield of nearly 6 percent, would be held steady through 2017.\nShares in the company traded 2.7 percent higher by 1230 GMT (0830 EDT) as the FTSE 100 index was up 0.1 percent.\n($1 = 0.6846 pounds)\n(Reporting by Ben Hirschler; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle)\nNext In Health News\n",

REUTERS/Yves Herman\nBy Philip Blenkinsop | BRUSSELS\nBRUSSELS Brewing giant Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR) plans to sell the eastern European assets of SABMiller SAB.L, which could fetch almost $8 billion, as it seeks European regulatory approval for its $100 billion-plus takeover of its closest rival.\nAB InBev has already lined up Japan's Asahi Group Holdings (2502.T) to buy SABMiller's Grolsch, Peroni and Meantime brands for 2.55 billion euros ($2.90 billion), and said on Friday it had put up for sale SABMiller's business in Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia.\nAB InBev, maker of Budweiser and Stella Artois, has barely any business in eastern Europe outside Russia and Ukraine, so analysts say the sale is more about preventing regulatory delays and exiting weak spots than ensuring market competition.\nBeer consumption in eastern Europe has been on the decline, due to shrinking populations, weak economies and tighter regulation. That makes the region much less attractive than the growth markets of Africa and Latin America that are driving what will be the biggest deal in consumer goods history.\n\"The eastern European markets may have provided an unwelcome and unnecessary distraction, and valuation notwithstanding, we regard this asset sale as a net positive\" for AB InBev, said Morningstar analyst Philip Gorham.\nHe estimates a sale could fetch $7.75 billion, based on a multiple of 11 times expected 2016 operating earnings of $705 million, with Carlsberg (CARLb.CO) the most likely buyer, though it might face antitrust constraints in Poland.\nMolson Coors (TAP.N) could have antitrust trouble buying the assets, following its purchase in 2013 of eastern Europe's StarBev from CVC Capital Partners [CVC.UL]. Heineken (HEIN.AS) might also face hurdles from competition regulators.\nBut SAB's business could be attractive to a private equity group or Asahi if it wanted further European expansion, analysts said.\nAB InBev has notified the European Commission, the European Union's antitrust regulator, which is set to deliver its verdict on the takeover of SAB by May 24.\nIf the Commission chose to open an in-depth investigation into the SAB deal, it would not receive clearance for up to 90 working days, a delay AB InBev may be keen to avoid.\nAB InBev said in a statement the sale included a number of top brands in local markets, such as Pilsner Urquell in Czech Republic and Dreher in Hungary. It said it expected considerable interest from potential buyers.\nThe sale is conditional on AB InBev concluding its purchase of SAB, expected in the second half of this year.\n(Additional reporting by Martinne Geller in London and Esha Vaish in Bengaluru; Editing by Jon Boyle and Mark Potter)\nNext In Deals\n",

A group of traders made 27.4 million pounds over the period thanks to higher fees from hedge funds, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority said in a statement Tuesday.\nAviva paid eight funds 132 million pounds in March 2014 after finding two former fixed-income traders had handled some trades improperly. The London-based insurer, which is Britain’s second-largest by market value, notified the regulator when it uncovered the misconduct and disclosed the policy breach in March.\nThis case is a “reminder to firms of the importance of managing conflicts of interest effectively by implementing a robust control environment with effective systems,” Georgina Philippou, the FCA’s acting director of enforcement and market oversight, said in the statement. “Not doing so risks customers’ interests being overlooked in favor of commercial or personal interests.”\nUnder Aviva’s structure, hedge funds, which could pay as much as a 20 percent performance fee, could be managed along with long-only funds, which paid much less, according to the FCA. Traders could delay the allocation of trades and watch their performance during the day before deciding to place them in a different fund to receive more fees, the FCA said.\n“We fully accept the conclusions of this investigation,” Aviva Investors Global Services Chief Executive Officer Euan Munro said in a statement. “We have fixed the issues. We have also made substantial changes to the management team, which is leading the turnaround of Aviva Investors.”\nAviva received a 30 percent reduction in the penalty in exchange for its early cooperation, the FCA said.\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

This followed a string of production outlook cuts after its gas and LNG business in Egypt performed disastrously.\nShell is still awaiting regulatory approvals for the BG deal from the European Union, China and Australia, after Brazil, the United States and South Korea cleared it.

  "articleText" : "Standard Life share price: Group gets approval to hike stake in India JV\nHDFC Life expected to float this year\nby Tsveta Zikolova Friday, 01 Apr 2016, 10:59 BST\nStandard Life (LON:SL) has secured regulatory approval to raise its stake in its joint venture in India, the FTSE 100 insurer has said. The move comes after the company unveiled plans to hike its interest in HDFC Life last summer as it looks to tap into Indiaâ€™s potentially vast insurance market.\nStandard Lifeâ€™s share price has been subdued in todayâ€™s session, having lost 1.29 percent to 351.50p as of 10:27 BST, and slightly underperforming the benchmark FTSE 100 index which currently stands 0.93 percent lower at 6,117.65 points. The shares have lost over a quarter of their value over the past year, and are down over nine percent in the year-to-date.\nStandard Life said in a statement to the London Stock Exchange this morning that it had obtained all necessary regulatory approvals to increase its stake in HDFC Standard Life Insurance Company by nine percent for a consideration of about Â£179 million. The transaction, which is expected to complete in the next two weeks, will take the groupâ€™s stake in the venture from 26 percent to 35 percent.\nâ€œWe are delighted that we have obtained the approvals necessary to increase our stake demonstrating our long-term commitment to India and the future success of HDFC Life,â€� the FTSE 100 insurerâ€™s chief executive Keith Skeoch said in the statement.\nStandard Life proposed the deal last summer, after Indiaâ€™s parliament passed legislation allowing foreign companies to increase holdings in local ventures. In December, Reuters quoted bankers as saying that HDFC Life was expected to raise more than $300 million via an initial public offering (IPO) in 2016, making it the first insurer to list on the Indian bourses. Standard Lifeâ€™s chief financial officer Luke Savage had previously told the newswire that an IPO of the venture was the route the company would be looking to take.\n",

Pay-as-you-go customers can't currently get it.\nHere's what to do:\nOn your phone, go to the Google Play store and download the Tesco Mobile Xtras app .\nSign up in the app, entering your age, interests and preferences to ensure the ads served up by the app are targeted to you. That's it.\nWhat kind of content will I see?\nYou'll see adverts and promotions from a wide array of  brands such as British Airways, McDonalds and Doritos, but you may also see news and sport stories from The Sun and The Times.\nThere are no gambling offers or sexually explicit or 'adult' content, so if a child uses your phone they won't be at risk of seeing anything they shouldn't.\nIn theory there are no video adverts and no sound. But we've had one report from an Xtras user who saw an embedded video in a Halifax advert which autoplayed when they unlocked their phone. As their phone was on silent at the time, the user couldn't confirm whether there was any accompanying sound.\nWe spoke to Unlockd, the technology company behind the app, and they said that the advert in question \"slipped through\" by mistake after being categorised incorrectly, and that they were looking into this. They added that relatively few customers had seen the advert in question, and said that neither that advert nor any other content on Xtras makes a sound.\nAre the ads annoying?\nWe can't answer that  it  depends on your personal tolerance levels when it comes to adverts. But the lack of video or noisy content (assuming mistakes like the one above aren't a regular occurrence) means it won't be as obnoxious as it could be.\nTesco Mobile customers can save £3 off their monthly bill with the Xtras app\nHow much data does it use?\nTesco Mobile says the app will  typically use 100-120MB of data on average each month, though it could vary. But to compensate you'll be given an extra 200MB of data each month (on top of any allowances your monthly package gives you).\nThis means most users won't lose out and are actually likely to gain a small amount of data by using the app.\nIf you go abroad the app automatically pauses itself to avoid racking up huge data charges, and will only work if you connect to Wi-Fi.\nAnd if I want to cancel?\nYou can cancel at any time by deleting the app  you simply won't get the monthly discount. You can reinstall the app in future if you decide to go back.\nYou can also pause the app for up to two hours at a time, ensuring you don't see any promotional content when you unlock your phone during that period.\nCould it become available to pay-as-you-go customers or those on other networks?\nTesco Mobile told us it will review  the success of the app and may possibly extend it to its pay-as-you-go customers in future.\nXtras is actually a partnership between Tesco Mobile and Australian tech company Unlockd. It's an exclusive collaboration in the UK, so there's no immediate prospect of other networks using the same app.\nAnd what about the other type of data  my personal data?\nThe app developers Unlocked say any  data you enter into the Xtras app (such as your age and interests) is encrypted and held securely by Unlockd. It isn't sold to or shared  with  anyone  not even Tesco.\nIf you delete the app your data is archived by Unlockd, so you can opt back in to the service quickly and easily if you decide to give it another chance.\nRemember though that if you click through from an Xtras advert  and enter any personal data (for example, to enter a competition), you're giving that information away to a third party which may sell it on.\nDoes the discount make it worth switching to Tesco Mobile?\nTo weigh up how much more competitive Tesco Mobile Sims are if you're able to get the £3/month off, we compared its 30-day Sim-only  deals against the cheapest comparable deals (all offering 4G mobile internet) that we could find elsewhere.\nHow does Tesco Mobile's Xtras weigh up?\nPackage size\n",

REUTERS/Stefan Wermuth\nBy Sarah Young | LONDON\nLONDON SABMiller SAB.L is buying Britain's Meantime Brewing Company, swallowing up one of the pioneers of the country's craft brewing movement to give the owner of big brands such as Peroni and Grolsch exposure to a fast-growing part of the drinks market.\nA surge in demand for craft beers in recent years has stolen market share from the world's two biggest brewers, SABMiller and Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR), as drinkers seek new tastes and support niche, local suppliers.\nSales volumes of Meantime's beers including London Pale Ale and London Lager soared 58 percent in 2014, compared with a 1 percent rise in Britain's beer market as a whole. The more richly flavored craft beer also sells at a premium to standard lager, another draw for SABMiller.\nHowever, some supporters of craft beer say brands such as Meantime, which was founded in 1999 with the backing of a group of friends in a former tramshed in Greenwich, south London, risk losing their appeal if they sell out to a global brewer.\n\"I probably won't be drinking Meantime anymore,\" said Jeff Rosenmeier, founder of the Lovibonds craft brewery in Henley-on-Thames, southern England, though he conceded most drinkers  wouldn't notice and only \"beer geeks\" would turn away from it.\n\"Lame, lame, lame,\" wrote one craft beer fan on Twitter, while another said \"Goodbye to a indie brewery success story\".\nMeantime chief executive Nick Miller, who joined from SABMiller in 2011, rejected the criticism.\n\"Why would Meantime suddenly not become a craft beer just because it's got a different set of shareholders?\" he asked on a call with reporters.\n\"Are you telling me that shareholders determine whether you're craft or not? Surely it's about the liquid, the beers that you produce, and the passion that you have for producing beer?\"\nMeantime's founder Alastair Hook, its brew master, and Miller will continue to be part of Meantime following completion of the deal, expected in early June.\nSABMiller said it aimed to grow sales of Meantime's beers across Britain and use its distribution networks to export it to other markets in Europe.\nAB InBev bought Goose Island, a U.S. craft beer brand, in 2011, and in the past year acquired craft names Blue Point and 10 Barrels, prompting a backlash on social media, with the three brands featuring on the website \"Craftbeerblacklist\".\nSABMiller's U.S. joint venture with Molson Coors, MillerCoors, already sells Blue Moon in that country, another beer that plays in the craft beer category, although it has also faced some criticism.\nDespite that, analysts welcomed SABMiller's expansion into a fast-growing market.\n\"The variety of styles added to SAB's extensive local and heritage beer menu should serve it well,\" Accendo Market's Mike van Dulken said.\nSABMiller shares were up 1.2 percent at 3,644 pence at 1120 GMT (7.20 a.m. ET), within a UK blue-chip index up 0.3 percent .FTSE .\nThe financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but will be small in the context of SABMiller's market capitalization of 58 billion pounds ($91 billion). SABMiller sold 245 million hectolitres of lager in 2014, compared with Meantime's annual capacity for production of 120,000 hectolitres.\n(This story was refiled to fix the spelling of Grolsch in the first paragraph)\n(Editing by Keith Weir and Mark Potter)\nNext In Deals\n",

The agency is pushing towns like Shannon in western Ireland as ideal destinations for administrative employees because they offer low costs and ample office space, one of the people said.\nThe U.K. will vote June 23 on whether to remain part of the EU. London’s financiers have warned a so-called Brexit vote will prompt overseas banks to move jobs elsewhere, because some financial products\ncan’t be traded outside the EU without specific agreements.\n“Brexit could initially challenge the current operational structures of some U.K. and international banks which do cross-border business” and require “re-engineering to ensure access to the single market,” Carlos Suarez Duarte, an analyst at Moody’s Investors Service, said in a report this month.\nIDA Chief Executive Officer Martin Shanahan told the Irish Independent newspaper in March that he had met with “some financial services companies” and discussed Brexit, without providing specifics.\n“Encouraging investment into regional locations outside of Dublin is a key part of the IDA Ireland’s strategy,” the agency said in an e-mailed statement Monday, declining to comment further. Standard Chartered and RBS declined to comment.\nIDA Ireland, based in Dublin, is charged with luring overseas firms to the country, which has a 12.5 percent corporate tax rate, the lowest in Western Europe. More than 1,200 foreign companies, including Facebook Inc., Apple Inc. and Pfizer Inc., have operations in Ireland, and the government wants 900 new “investments” by 2019, according to the state agency’s website. Amid a dearth of office space in Dublin, the IDA is building so-called “advance office facilities” outside the capital.\nBanks that have moved some operations to Ireland include Credit Suisse Group AG, which said in December that it will make Dublin its primary hub for servicing hedge funds in Europe and move staff from London. The company, which considered London before settling on Ireland, will employ about 100 people in connection with the trading floor.\nFinancial CEOs who have discussed the implications of Brexit include Stuart Gulliver of HSBC Holdings Plc, who said in February that the lender would probably need to move about 1,000 investment bankers linked to operations governed by MiFID II, the EU rules covering everything from derivatives trading to bond pricing, to Paris.\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

One is, today we are one of the largest movers of money -up to $1 trillion or more on a daily basis -because we're the only bank that ac tually operates in 100 coun tries. So, there is obviously an opportunity around our own general ledgers,\" said Aditya Menon, managing director of global digital strategy at Citigroup.\nMenon further said: \"We like the idea of a cryptocur rency that doesn't have vol atility. We are experiment ing with the idea of a fiat-backed digital curren cy -backed by a pound or a dollar or euro as the case may be. So, there is some in terest there.\"\nThe company's bet on blockchain comes at a time when the traditional bank ing and financial services industry is facing rapid disruption from the rise of new-age payments banks, mobile wallets and cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.\n\"For us it's not so much about bitcoin because bitcoin is something that has very volatile value, questionable in terms of an entry in and entry out from a regulatory perspective. But if you think about the distributed ledger -that is extremely valuable,\" said Menon, who also heads application programme interface development at Citigroup. Traditional banks like Citi and JP Morgan are scrambling to play catch-up with new-age fintech companies that are starting to leverage blockchain technology .\nAccording to a July report from the International Business Times, Citigroup has built its own digital currency based on bitcoin and the blockchain called CitiCoin.\nExperts see blockchain technology as hugely disruptive since it completely overhauls the traditional methods of transacting and maintaining online records, and allows banks and people to directly exchange money without having to rely on the additional, more expensive layers of middlemen.\n\"Blockchain gives you the ability to not only update a distributed ledger but settle it, which otherwise is a laborious process especially if you're doing it across multiple countries and times zones, etc. So there is one opportunity there,\" said Menon. He said trade finance is another area, citing the example of open-account trading.\"There is a last-mile hostage situation where money , documents need to change hands. So, if you use a distributed ledger to actually record ownership of title of the goods and then that changes hands based on the payments -that's a great example of how you can use blockchain technology to facilitate a trade transaction, which otherwise has been done in a very manual-intense way,\" he said.\nAt the company's research and development labs in Dublin, a team of researchers and executives are currently experimenting with the use of blockchain in traditional financial services.\nA number of regulators have also started looking at blockchain as a viable alternate way to run real-time payments and settlements, said Menon.\nStay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!\nDON'T MISSany stories, follow us on Twitter Follow\nFROM AROUND THE WEB\n",

The joint venture would explore the possibility of sourcing new ships that are designed and built in China, along with the possibility of acquiring existing cruise ships.\nPort & Destination Development Joint Venture: In this potential joint venture, CMG and Carnival Corporation would collaborate to develop turnaround and transit ports within and around China beginning with a flagship port currently being developed by CMG called Prince Bay Cruise Terminal in Shekou, which is located in Shenzhen. The partners would work to have cruise ships sail from this flagship port, while also developing other cruise ship destinations across China and Northern Asia.\n\"The MOU we signed today signifies a great opportunity to take the next step in the future of Chinese cruising, while addressing some key needs for both the cruise industry and its passengers in China,\" said Alan Buckelew, COO of Carnival Corporation. \"With CMG's amazing track record, reach and influence in the market, we are working with a strategic partner that can help us explore immediate ways to impact cruise growth in China, including the possibility of a new Chinese cruise brand and new destinations.\"\nCarnival Corporation and CMG formalized their strategic partnership during an event held today at the Hilton Shenzhen Shekou, including an MOU signing ceremony involving Yang Tian Ping, general manager of China Merchants Shekou Industrial Zone, and Alan Buckelew, chief operations officer of Carnival Corporation. The ceremony was also attended by the vice president of China Merchants Group, Sun Cheng Ming, among other distinguished officials and guests.\nCMG, China's oldest state enterprise founded in 1872, focuses on transportation, infrastructure, financial services and real estate development, and has had a critical impact on the development of China's economy over the company's more than 140-year history. In support of China's goal to become a preeminent global cruise market, CMG and Carnival Corporation are collaborating as strategic partners to develop the infrastructure required to help accelerate growth in the cruise industry, which is one of the key emerging industries that could help fuel China's overall maritime economy.\nWhile pursuing potential joint ventures to develop and grow the overall cruise market in China, Carnival Corporation remains committed to serving its Chinese guests who are already sailing on the two Carnival brands that give the company the cruise industry's leading presence in China – Costa Cruises and Princess Cruises.\nCarnival Corporation just recently announced its plans for immediate capacity growth in China in 2015 to meet growing demand. With Costa Cruises adding the Costa Serena in China in April of this year, Carnival Corporation will be the first global cruise company with four ships homeported in China. Costa Serena joins Costa Atlantica, Costa Victoria and Sapphire Princess already homeported in China. Carnival Corporation is growing its leading market presence by 140 percent from 2013 – 2015 and expects to carry 500,000 cruise passengers in China in 2015.\nAbout Carnival Corporation\nCarnival Corporation & plc is the largest cruise company in the world, with a portfolio of cruise brands in North America, Europe, Australia and Asia, comprised of Carnival Cruise Line, Holland America Line, Princess Cruises, Seabourn, AIDA Cruises, Costa Cruises, Cunard, P&O Cruises (Australia) and P&O Cruises (UK).\nTogether, these brands operate 100 ships totaling 212,000 lower berths with 10 new ships scheduled to be delivered between 2015 and 2018. Carnival Corporation & plc also operates Holland America Princess Alaska Tours, the leading tour companies in Alaska and the Canadian Yukon.

JP Morgan analysts said these Phase III decisions were largely expected.\nGSK's R&D event in New York is one of three high-profile investor days being held by major European pharmaceutical companies this week.

  "articleText" : "British American Tobacco accused of bribing senior politicians in order to sabotage anti-smoking laws\nSeveral individuals involved with the WHO's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control allegedly targeted\nMonday 30 November 2015 18:38 BST\nClick to follow\nThe Independent Online\nThe allegations against BAT have come from whistleblowers from inside the company, and are supported by court documents Corbis\nBritish American Tobacco, one of Britain’s biggest companies, has been accused of bribing senior politicians and civil servants in a bid to sabotage anti-smoking laws.\nThe allegations by whistleblowers from the company, and supported by court documents, relate to the company’s operations in several African countries.\nPaul Hopkins, who served in the Irish Special Forces before working for BAT, claims he broke the law for the tobacco firm. “I was a commercial hitman,” he said in an interview broadcast on BBC One’s Panorama.\nCommenting on the practice of bribery, Mr Hopkins, who worked for BAT in Kenya for 13 years, said: “It was explained to me in Africa that's the cost of doing business.”\nSeveral individuals involved with the World Health Organisation’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) were allegedly targeted.\nUnder the UK Bribery Act, British companies can be prosecuted for bribery which takes place overseas. And anti-smoking campaigners are demanding the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) launch a criminal investigation into BAT.\nPaul Hopkins worked for BAT in Kenya for 13 years, and was led to believe that bribery was part of the cost of doing business in Africa (Corbis)\n“BAT is bribing people, and I'm facilitating it,” claimed Mr Hopkins, who no longer works for the company.\nBefore he left, he recorded conversations with his boss, Gary Fagan, BAT’s director for East and Central Africa, and a company lawyer Naushad Ramoly, discussing bribes. In an exchange in 2013, the lawyer said: “That’s what we are going to be paying. Yeah, ok, fine. Anything else that you think we’ll need to be paying for?” Mr Ramoly, who no longer works for BAT, denies involvement in illegal activities. And Mr Fagan denies giving permission for the payment of bribes.\nTwo FCTC representatives, Godefroid Kamwenubusa, from Burundi, and Chaibou Bedja Abdou, from the Comoros Islands, were both allegedly paid $3,000 (£2,000), according to the Panorama investigation. And Bonaventure Nzeyimana, a former FCTC representative from Rwanda, was allegedly paid $20,000. All three deny accepting bribes. But in court documents, BAT describes the payments to the three as “unlawful bribes,” according to the BBC.\nAnother allegedly bribed was Moses Watangula, former Minister of Trade, Kenya. The tobacco company paid for a business class return flight for his wife to London. He denies having had dealings with BAT.\nAnd Dr Kasirivu Atwooki, a Ugandan MP who sat on a committee writing a report on a rival company, was allegedly given £20,000 to make amendments and give it to BAT in advance. He denies the allegations.\nWorld news in pictures\nTokyo residents woke up Thursday to the first November snowfall in more than 50 years\nAP\nSupporters of same-sex marriage attend a rally at the Legislative Yuan in Taipei, Taiwan\nReuters\n3/29 24 November 2016\nPeople protest against a proposal to legalize same-sex marriage at the Legislative Yuan in Taipei, Taiwan\nReuters\n4/29 24 November 2016\nAt least 40 people were killed when part of a power station under construction in China\nGetty\n5/29 24 November 2016\nWorkers search through the remains of a collapsed platform in a cooling tower at a power station at Fengcheng, in China's Jiangxi province\nGetty\n6/29 24 November 2016\nFairground stallhorders block the access to the Place de la Concorde  in support of Gerard Campion, whom is required from the state to remove his ferris wheel\nGetty\n7/29 24 November 2016\nMembers of the Communist Party of India shout slogans outside a bank during a protest against Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the withdrawal of high-value banknotes from circulation, in Chennai\nGetty\n8/29 24 November 2016\nIndian police detain a member of the Communist Party of India outside a bank during a protest against Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the withdrawal of high-value banknotes from circulation\nGetty\n9/29 24 November 2016\nIndia's rupee headed towards a record low against the dollar, weakened by the government's shock currency shake-up and a greenback surge on expectations of a rate hike next month\nReuters\n10/29 24 November 2016\nIndian police tug at a member of the Communist Party of India during a protest against Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the withdrawal of high-value banknotes from circulation, in Chennai\nGetty\n11/29 24 November 2016\nAn Indonesian prison guard removes handcuffs from Australian Sara Connor, before her trial in Bali, Indonesia.

If true, it is hard to imagine any more disgusting act for a British company than to pay decision makers in Africa to prevent legislation being passed to protect children and young people from a future of addiction, disease and premature death caused by smoking.”\nShe added: “We will be writing to the Government to demand that a criminal investigation under the Bribery Act is launched at once.”\nRead more\n",

REUTERS/Jim Young\nNEW YORK Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) on Tuesday disclosed a 5 percent stake in agricultural equipment maker Deere & Co (DE.N) and said it shed a $3.74 billion investment in oil company Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) as oil prices plunged.\nThe changes were among several that Berkshire made in its common stock investments in the fourth quarter, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing detailing the conglomerate's domestic equity investments as of Dec. 31.\nBerkshire began accumulating the bulk of its 17.1 million-share stake in Deere, worth $1.51 billion at year end, in the third quarter of 2014, but had not previously disclosed it. The SEC often lets Buffett quietly accumulate large stakes to deter copycats.\nDeere shares rose 1.2 percent in after-market trading.\nShares of companies often rise after Berkshire reveals new investments because some investors consider it a vote of confidence by Buffett and try to copy him.\nDeere declined to comment.\nBerkshire's decision to dispose of its entire 41 million-share stake in Exxon Mobil was unusual for Berkshire because the stake had been recently acquired, dating only to 2013.\nExxon shares have outperformed many peers in recent months, losing only about 15 percent of their value from June through January as oil prices slumped by more than half.\nIt is unclear why Buffett appeared to have soured on Exxon, or whether Berkshire made money on the investment.\nBuffett \"is of course a value investor, and the fact of the matter is that Exxon shares held up extremely well during the oil price meltdown,\" said Raymond James energy analyst Pavel Molchanov in an interview.\nExxon Mobil declined to comment.\nBerkshire also reported a new stake of 4.7 million shares in Rupert Murdoch's media company Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O).\nIt further reported a new 8.4 million-share stake in Restaurant Brands International Inc (QSR.N) (QSR.TO), the parent of the Burger King and Tim Hortons restaurant chains.

  "articleText" : "Advertisement\n5 years after BP spill: What's changed in offshore drilling\nIn this April 21, 2010 photo provided by the U.S. Coast Guard, fire boat response crews spray water on the burning BP Deepwater Horizon offshore oil rig.\nCain Burdeau,  The Associated Press\nPublished Monday, April 20, 2015 8:24AM EDT\nNEW ORLEANS -- As oil gushed from BP's ruptured well five years ago and public outrage built by the day, the Obama administration issued a six-month moratorium on drilling in the Gulf of Mexico.\nWhen the well was finally capped after nearly three months, political and industry pressure mounted on the White House to lift the ban, which it did about a month earlier than planned.\nSince then, oil and gas drilling Gulf has bounced back strongly and the number of deep-water drilling rigs has actually increased from 35 to about 48. Drillers are pushing into even deeper water and greater depths below the sea floor to reach reservoirs considered riskier than the Macondo field, the source of the nation's worst offshore spill.\nElsewhere, the Obama administration has pushed to open up offshore waters in Alaska and along the Atlantic coast to drilling. In January, the Interior Department unveiled a plan to open up drilling next year in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas on the Arctic coast of Alaska and off the coast between Maryland and Florida.\nHere's a look at what else has changed and what hasn't in the world of offshore drilling in the five years since BP's April 20, 2010, Macondo catastrophe:\nINDUSTRY OVERSIGHT\nThe Minerals Management Service, the agency overseeing drilling when the BP disaster occurred, is now defunct. It was widely considered ineffective as a regulator and incapable of keeping up with changes in a high-tech industry, and the Obama administration broke it up into three entities.\nNow exploration and environmental planning are handled by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, drilling safety and inspections by the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, and the collection of offshore royalties by the Office of Natural Resources Revenue.\nThe number of offshore inspectors working the Gulf has increased to about 92, nearly twice as many as before the BP spill, according to the enforcement bureau. Federal inspectors do more rigorous inspections of blowout preventers, the devices that are meant to shut off an out-of-control well.\nOil and gas companies are now required to complete extensive safety audits in which drillers must assess vulnerabilities and risks.\nOther problems in this area persist. Among other issues, the spill exposed the government's dependency on the industry for the expertise and equipment needed to cope with a broken underwater well. Regulators acknowledge they still depend on the industry and find it hard to keep up with innovations.\nGovernment agencies have long had trouble retaining engineers and inspectors, who can make much better salaries in the astronomically profitable energy sector. The Government Accountability Office noted in February that the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement struggles to keep enough highly trained personnel.\nWatchdogs say the regulatory changes have been slow and largely incremental.\nSAFETY AND PREVENTION\nAfter the BP blowout, regulators came under fire for approving drilling plans that included dead people and response plans for animals that don't exist in the Gulf, such as the walrus. Since then, exploration and drilling plans are vetted more carefully and must be approved by independent engineers.\nStill, many aspects of drilling plans remain largely secret, shielded by proprietary interests.\nRegulators also increased drilling standards for how to drill wells - for example, requiring new testing for cement and extra safety barriers - following the spill. But critics point out that key recommendations made by independent panels were not carried out and that Congress failed to enact new legislation to strengthen the safety of offshore drilling.\nLast week, the U.S. Department of the Interior announced new proposals requiring operators to install blowout preventers that would have more backup measures. The blowout preventer is a massive piece of equipment meant to shut in an out-of-control well, the piece that failed in the Macondo disaster.\nThose rules won't take effect for at least another five years, however.\nSPILL RESPONSE\nWhen BP's well began spewing oil, the company and its industry partners found themselves unprepared for a spill of such size. Supplies of oil-stopping boom soon were used up. Idled fishing boats were converted to skimmers on the fly. A series of attempts by BP to contain the spill at the source failed; BP and the Coast Guard wound up soliciting ideas from the public and experts before a giant containment stack finally capped the well.\nAfterward, oil companies set up the Marine Well Containment Co. and Helix Well Containment Group to develop better technology to contain spills. The two groups say they have systems for placing stacks over an out-of-control well and capturing huge amounts of oil and gas escaping from a blowout - up to 130,000 barrels of oil a day and 220 million cubic feet of gas in 10,000 feet of water, twice the depth of the Macondo well.\nBut the containment systems have not been tested during an actual blowout and in some cases - for instance, a total blowout, or even one that fractures the seafloor - they would not be able to capture all the leaking oil.\nMeanwhile, other industry groups that specialize in cleanup say they have vastly increased their capacity to respond. For example, Clean Gulf Associates Inc. says it has increased its absorbent boom from 10,000 feet to 55,000 feet and added several large skimmers to its fleet.\nBut doubts persist over whether boom does much good in turbulent offshore conditions.\nCleanup groups have also developed new devices for spraying dispersants on a spill, both underwater and from the air. Environmentalists remain wary about the toxic nature of dispersants, chemicals that break oil into tiny parts, and critics say regulators have failed to push the industry to develop non-toxic alternatives.\nRelated Stories\n",

The medicine shows promise against an incurable form of leukemia as well as auto-immune diseases such as lupus, and could spark a bidding war for Acerta, said Jo Walton, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG.\n“We believe acalabrutinib complements AstraZeneca’s oncology portfolio and also offers the potential for use in autoimmune disorders,” Walton and colleagues wrote in a note to clients. “If Acerta is open to a transaction, we would expect significant interest from multiple other bidders.”\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported the talks on Friday, citing a deal value of more than $5 billion. A large part of that is likely to be performance-related payments and milestones, Bloomberg Intelligence’s Sam Fazeli said in a note on Monday.\nBlockbuster Potential\nAstraZeneca Chief Executive Officer Pascal Soriot is hunting for promising new medicines after turning down a deal with Pfizer Inc. last year. Just last month, it agreed to buy ZS Pharma for $2.7 billion in cash, scooping up a potential blockbuster for a deadly blood condition that had also attracted Swiss drugmaker Actelion Ltd.\nThe stock rose 0.3 percent to 4,342.50 pence at 12:47 p.m. in London on Monday.\nLike Imbruvica, acalabrutinib belongs to a class of drugs called Burton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which work by blocking the BTK enzyme from promoting proliferation and survival of malignant cells. It’s now in the most advanced phase of clinical tests. In an earlier trial, it worked on a deadly form of leukemia with milder side effects than Imbruvica. Other drugmakers developing BTK inhibitors are Eli Lilly & Co. together with Hanmi Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. and Germany’s Merck KGaA.\nAcerta’s chief executive is the former chief medical officer of Pharmacyclics Inc., which developed Imbruvica, and the company’s “established clinical excellence and management team” could be part of the attraction for AstraZeneca, according to the Credit Suisse note.\nImbruvica, a pill first approved by U.S. regulators in 2013, is projected to be a blockbuster with sales surpassing $1 billion for J&J as soon as next year. Annual revenue from that drug will reach $4.07 billion by 2020, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal. LEARN MORE\nRead this next\n",

Photograph: Matt Cardy/Getty Images\nTuesday 12 April 2016 13.01 BST\nLast modified on Tuesday 12 April 2016 13.39 BST\nClose\nThis article is 8 months old\nTesco has agreed to sell half its stake in Lazada, a south-east Asian online retailer, to China’s Alibaba for about £90m as the UK supermarket group concentrates on its home business.\nTesco said it would sell 8.6% of Lazada to Alibaba, the world’s largest retailer, for $129m (£90.6m) in a deal valuing the business at $1.5bn. Alibaba will invest $500m in new Lazada shares as well as buying out Tesco and other investors in the Singapore-based retailer.\nTesco will retain an 8.3% stake in Lazada after the transaction completes, including the issue of new shares, but Alibaba will have an option to buy out remaining investors within 12 to 18 months.\nThe deal values Tesco’s Lazada stake at significantly more than the £113m carrying value listed in its accounts last August. Tesco, which reports its annual results on Wednesday, classified Lazada as an asset available for sale for the financial year that ended in February.\nTesco results: analysts expect strong start to the year\nRead more\nThe former Tesco chief executive Philip Clarke bought 19.6% of Lazada in November 2013 as the grocer sought to improve its online capabilities in Asia. It has invested $124m in the business. Under new management after a series of profit warnings, Tesco has retrenched to overhaul its UK stores and has been selling international operations such as its business in South Korea .\nAlibaba, which sells almost 1bn consumer products, has overtaken Tesco and Walmart of the US to become the world’s biggest retailer. It is expanding beyond China , where it makes about 90% of revenue, and wants to tap into fast-growing south-east Asian consumer markets such as Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand.\nMichael Evans, Alibaba’s president, said: “Globalisation is a critical strategy for the growth of Alibaba today and well into the future. With the investment in Lazada, Alibaba gains access to a platform with a large and growing consumer base outside China, a proven management team and a solid foundation for future growth in one of the most promising regions for ecommerce globally.”\nThe deal will take Alibaba into a region where no single operator yet dominates. While south-east Asia’s growing affluence is expected to fuel growth in online shopping, many countries in the region lack transport and payments systems required for online retailing to take off.\nTesco said it would use the money from the sale for general working capital purposes.\n",

These are increasingly popular. Previously, these funds, which are quoted on the stock market, were lumped in with shares, but the two types of investment will now be charged for separately.\nInvestors will now pay up to £45 a year to hold shares and the same to hold trusts, whereas previously they paid up to £45 to hold both. In other words, the charge will double to £90 a year. However, the maximum charge for each type is much higher – £200 a year – for those who save in personal pensions or Sipps. These clients could therefore pay £200 a year more.\nBut investors with smaller sums will be better off. Below the caps, they will pay a percentage fee, which falls from 0.5pc a year to 0.45pc.\nA spokesman for Hargreaves Lansdown said the company was making the change because trading in investment trusts was costly to administer.\nOther new charges introduced include £24 for posting twice-yearly statements and £30 for closing an account or transferring holdings in cash to another provider.\nHargreaves is also introducing a fee of £12 for shareholders who want to attend company meetings or take part in rights issues or other \"corporate actions\".\nA spokesman said Hargreaves had tried to make the document setting out the changes as \"clear and simple as possible\".\n• Get Twitter alerts for all our investing stories: follow @telegraphinvest\n",

  "articleText" : "Barclays to accelerate its focus on `core strengths'\nTurmoil in markets threatens revenue, carries into 2016\nShare on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp\nA revenue slump is adding urgency to cost cutting at Barclays Plc and Deutsche Bank AG, where new chief executive officers are racing to raise profitability.\nBarclays said Thursday it’s accelerating a plan to focus on “core strengths and running the business for returns,” while shutting offices in nine countries. Deutsche Bank, based in Frankfurt, said Wednesday that revenue dropped about 16 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, driven by its securities unit, Europe’s largest.\nThe volatility that affected trading at the end of last year carried into 2016 as doubts about growth in China persisted and the selloff in crude oil deepened. Europe’s biggest investment banks, which saw profitability shrink as regulators tightened capital standards, now face increased pressure on revenue.\n“The environment worsened in the fourth quarter from the third and investors are asking themselves whether that’s the start of a trend,” said Michael Huenseler, who helps manage 17.4 billion euros ($18.8 billion) at Assenagon Asset Management in Munich. “If that’s the case, it would suggest that those banks who are taking the most radical action on cutting back their trading businesses are on the right track.”\nWhile Barclays said revenue at its investment bank, led by Tom King, was “broadly flat” in 2015 from the previous year, that implies that the unit’s income in the fourth quarter fell 11 percent. Deutsche Bank cited “challenging market conditions” for its fourth-quarter slump.\nThe comments suggest European securities firms are set to report a deeper decline in revenue than their competitors in the U.S. The five biggest U.S. firms saw their combined revenue from investment banking and trading fall 4.9 percent to $24.2 billion in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\nDeutsche Bank may have had a “decent” performance in foreign exchange and rates trading in the fourth quarter that still couldn’t make up for “challenging” revenues in credit, high-yield debt, leveraged lending and emerging markets trading, UBS Group AG analyst Daniele Brupbacher wrote in a note to clients.\nSlumping Shares\nBank shares have been hit by concern that China’s economy is slowing and that the fallout from a drop in commodity prices will erode corporate profits. The 46-company Stoxx Europe 600 Banks Index has fallen 14 percent this year. Deutsche Bank dropped 23 percent while Barclays declined 14 percent.\nEuropean bank shares are being undermined by concern over the industry’s profit sustainability, John Cryan, Deutsche Bank’s co-CEO, told reporters at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Wednesday. Markets may see current levels of volatility for years to come unless “we see active investment picking up,” he said.\n“The history of banks is to be too thinly capitalized, to be too leveraged in a very volatile business and that’s not a great recipe,” Credit Suisse Group AG CEO Tidjane Thiam said in a Bloomberg TV interview in Davos on Friday. “All the banks, and we at Credit Suisse, are working very hard to change that business model so that we bring it back to less volatility. But we’re not there yet, that’s a two, three-year journey.”\nCredit Suisse laid out plans in October to cut as many as 5,600 jobs and focus more on wealth management, while shrinking and splitting up the investment bank.\nDeutsche Bank is eliminating about 9,000 jobs on a net basis by 2018. While the company hasn’t broken out the number of positions that will go at its securities unit, the businesses it plans to shrink or close are mainly in its capital-intensive fixed-income trading arm.\nAsia Pullback\nBarclays CEO Jes Staley started a fresh round of cuts at the investment bank that will eliminate 1,200 jobs worldwide and shut securities operations across Asia, people with knowledge of the matter said this week. The biggest cuts at the London-based bank will fall in the Asia-Pacific region, and include winding up the cash equities business, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the decision isn’t public.\nCredit Suisse views the retreat of its competitors in some emerging markets as an opportunity to expand, according to Thiam. “When others are retrenching, suddenly teams who would never have talked to us, talk to us because others are leaving the region,” he said.\nU.S. banks are also trimming. Morgan Stanley eliminated about 1,200 employees last quarter, including about a quarter of the fixed-income trading staff, a person briefed on the matter said. Bank of America Corp., which cut more than 10,000 jobs last year, will reduce staffing in 2016 to trim costs amid declining revenue, CEO Brian Moynihan said in a Bloomberg TV interview in Davos.\n“Universal banks are nearly all coming to the same conclusion,” said Sandy Chen, an analyst at Cenkos Securities Plc in London. “When you’re allocating assets, investment banking is the lowest return business in terms of return on capital.”\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Make your car more fuel-efficient. You can do this by keeping your tyres inflated, taking the roof rack off, emptying your car of clutter and turning off your air con when driving at lower speeds.\n2. Drive more efficiently. Some ways to do this, include:\n– Accelerate gradually without over-revving\n– Always drive on the highest possible gear\n– If you can, allow your car to slow down naturally as your brake is a money burner\n– Re-starting your car is expensive, if you can keep moving\n3. Find the cheapest fuel prices. Use PetrolPrices.com. All you need to do is enter in your postcode and tell it how far you want to travel (up to 20 miles).\nHoward Cox, FairFuel UK co-founder told the Sun this morning: “Asda as usual is the first to cut pump prices significantly.\n“This welcome kick-start to fairer pump prices must make other retailers follow, albeit it has been a long time coming with wholesalers deliberately not passing at least 4p to millions of hard-working drivers in October.”\nRAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “While this level of cut is clearly good news it has come far too late as the wholesale price of fuel has been falling since the end of October when the oil price began to fall again.\n“Retailers should have reduced their prices then rather than making one bigger headline-grabbing cut now. The RAC called for a cut last week so it’s a case of better late than never.\n“The first two weeks of November unfortunately prove that the ‘rocket and feather’ does exist. This is a great shame as retailers previously had a good record of lowering their prices in response to wholesale cost savings.”\nWe pay for your stories!

REUTERS/Phil Noble\nBy Ben Hirschler | LONDON\nLONDON AstraZeneca's blood-thinning drug Brilinta cut the risk of death or heart attack in patients with a history of previous attacks, according to a major clinical trial that will boost hopes for the closely watched product.\nGiving Brilinta to patients who had a heart attack over a year ago could more than double the number of people eligible for the medicine, which the company has predicted could eventually generate sales of $3.5 billion a year.\nResults from the 21,000-patient study, known as PEGASUS, were released on Wednesday, lifting shares in AstraZeneca 1.5 percent by 5:00 a.m. EST, while the wider London market fell one percent.\nThe trial, which studied subjects who had a heart attack within the past one to three years, was designed to prove Brilinta's value beyond its current approved use in patients with acute coronary syndromes, or recent attacks.\nBrilinta has struggled so far to gain traction in a competitive market for blood thinners, where Plavix -- developed by Sanofi and Bristol-Myers Squibb -- is now available as a cheap generic. Brilinta also competes with Eli Lilly's Effient.\nAstraZeneca Chief Executive Pascal Soriot has made Brilinta a top priority and the company flagged its potential when he fought off a $118 billion bid by Pfizer last year, forecasting annual sales of $3.5 billion for the drug by 2023.\nThat makes Brilinta a critical component in AstraZeneca's wider goal of reaching overall sales of $45 billion by 2023, although many analysts remain skeptical.\nThe drug's sales in the first nine months of 2014 were $343 million and consensus forecasts point to them hitting only $1.23 billion by 2019, according to Thomson Reuters Cortellis.\nTom Keith-Roach, vice president for Brilinta, told Reuters he expected sales to strengthen through 2015 and the latest positive trial results should lead to expanded approvals in major markets over the next 18 months.\n\"This is very important news for the franchise,\" he said.\nAnalysts agreed the study was a clear win for AstraZeneca but said they wanted to see full details on the magnitude of clinical benefit, as well as data on bleeding. All blood-thinning drugs can cause bleeds.\nSo far, AstraZeneca has only said that the PEGASUS data was positive for both the 60 mg and 90 mg doses of Brilinta, when given alongside low-dose aspirin, and that preliminary analysis did not reveal any unexpected safety issues.\nComplete results from the study will be submitted to a scientific meeting in 2015.\nAstraZeneca is also conducting further studies looking at Brilinta's use in stroke, peripheral artery disease and diabetes.\n(Editing by Mark Potter and Keith Weir)\nNext In Health News\n",

  "articleText" : "Shire share price under pressure after $32bn Baxalta deal\nDeal fails to spark enthusiasm among analysts and investors\nby Tsveta Zikolova Tuesday, 12 Jan 2016, 08:15 GMT\nShares in Shire (LON:SHP) have been under pressure since the blue-chip drugmaker unveiled its $32-billion (Â£22 billion) deal to acquire Baxalta (NYSE:BXLT), with the agreement ending a near six-month-long pursuit. While the merger would complete Shireâ€™s transformation from a specialist in drugs for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder into a major producer of rare disease treatments, investors and analysts remain concerned about Baxaltaâ€™s dependence on its haemophilia business.\nShireâ€™s share price slumped 8.23 percent in yesterdayâ€™s session, having jumped over two percent immediately after the deal was announced. This morning, the stock has slipped further into the red, having shed 0.94 percent to 3,888.00p as of 08:01 GMT. Shares in Baxalta were also under pressure, and shed 2.27 percent to close at $39.10 in New York.\nThe London-listed rare disease specialist, which first approached Baxalta with an all-share offer over the summer, won over the US maker of treatments for rare blood conditions, cancers and immune system disorders, after sweetening the bid with a cash component. Shire will pay $45.57 a share for Baxalta, including $18 in cash. The price represents a 37.5-percent premium over the US companyâ€™s stock price before the initial bid was made public in August, weeks after Baxalta was spun off from US medical group Baxter.\nShire said yesterday that the deal is expected to yield annual operating cost synergies of over $500 million, and drive growth to over $20 billion in anticipated annual revenues by the end of the decade. Despite the upbeat forecasts, the tie-up has failed to spark enthusiasm among investors and analysts.\nâ€œA lot of people donâ€™t like the dealâ€� largely due to its dependence on Baxaltaâ€™s haemophilia franchise, John Boris, analyst with Suntrust Robinson Humphrey, told Reuters. The newswire also quoted analysts at UBS as cautioning that Baxalta could actually dilute Shire earnings from 2019 to 2023 before being accretive again from 2024.\nShireâ€™s chief executive Flemming Ornskov, however, is upbeat on the enlarged groupâ€™s prospects.\nâ€œThis was not a deal just for the sake of size,â€� the Dane told the Financial Times yesterday.  â€œWe want a leadership position in rare diseases, which we consider to be one of the most, if not the most, attractive segments of the pharmaceuticals market.â€�\nRare disease medicines, or orphan drugs as they are sometimes called, are a lucrative segment on account of their typically high prices and margins. Rare disease specialists also benefit from regulatory incentives such as fast-track approvals and longer periods of market exclusivity intended to encourage research and investment in the field.\n",

  "articleText" : "Add Your Note (Optional):\n \nLONDON (Alliance News) - The following stocks are amongst the biggest risers and fallers within the main London indices midday Thursday.\n-------\nFTSE 100 WINNERS\n-------\nAviva, up 5.7% and Friends Life Group, up 5.3%. Aviva said its turnaround is ongoing as it reported a fall in net profit for 2014 due to the 2013 sale of its US life and related internal asset management businesses, but operating profit excluding this rose as increases in its life business, general insurance and health helped to offset a fall in fund management operating profit. In what could be its last annual earnings statement in its current form with the proposed GBP5.6 billion acquisition of life insurance rival Friends Life Group expected to complete in the second quarter of 2015, Aviva said its net profit fell to GBP1.74 billion in 2014, compared with GBP2.15 billion in 2013. Friends Life, meanwhile, swung to a net loss of GBP138 million in 2014, compared with a net profit of GBP235 million in 2013.\nITV, up 2.4%. Goldman Sachs has added the broadcaster to its Conviction Buy List. On Wednesday the company proposed a GBP250 million special dividend at 6.25 pence per share and raised its total ordinary dividend for 2014, as it posted results ahead of expectations and higher than in 2013.\nSchroders, up 2.3%. The asset manager raised its dividend as it reported growth in pretax profit, net inflows from clients and assets under management in 2014. The company said it made a GBP517.1 million pretax profit in 2014, compared with GBP447.5 million in the prior year, as net revenue rose by GBP123.6 million to GBP1.53 billion and operating expenses increased by GBP55.3 million to GBP1.03 billion.\nRolls Royce Holdings, up 2.0%. The aerospace group said its Industria de Turbo Propulsores SA joint venture will supply the British engine maker with turbines for future civil large engines in addition to its existing range of products, under a revised shareholder agreement with joint venture partner Sener Grupo de Ingenieria SA.\n-------\nFTSE 100 LOSERS\n-------\nHSBC Holdings, down 2.3%. The Bank of England’s chief banking supervisor has told British lawamakers that he is holding HSBC Holdings' top executives' \"feet to the fire\" to ensure they simplify the group and improve its risk controls after a tax evasion scandal at its Swiss private bank, the Financial Times reports Thursday.\nRio Tinto, down 1.9%, and RSA Insurance Group, down 1.6%. The companies have gone ex-dividend, meaning new buyers no longer qualify for the latest dividend payouts.\nInternational Consolidated Airlines Group, down 1.1%. Ireland's government expects International Consolidated Airlines Group to make a further offer to convince it to sell its 25% stake in Aer Lingus, Ireland's Deputy Prime Minister Joan Burton said Thursday according to the BBC.\nAggreko, down 0.9%. The temporary power company reported a fall in profit in 2014, mainly due to large hit from the strength of sterling on its translated overseas earnings, while revenue was broadly flat as challenging trading in Asia Pacific offset strong growth in the Americas and a good performance in Europe, Middle East and Africa.\n-------\nFTSE 250 WINNERS\n-------\nBetfair Group, up 16%. The online betting firm revised up its full-year earnings expectations following a strong third quarter, its fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth as it continues to attract new customers. It said it expects a strong finish to the year with record levels of political betting in the run up to the UK general election in May.\nSpirax-Sarco Engineering, up 8.9%. The company added its name to the list of UK engineering businesses which saw results held back by the strength of sterling in 2014, with the company reporting a small fall in pretax profit, though the company sweetened the pill with a GBP91 million return of capital. Despite the fall in pretax profit, the company said it will increase its final dividend payment to 45 pence per share, from 41 pence last year, meaning its total dividend for the year will be 64.5 pence, up 9% on the 59 pence per share paid a year earlier.\nHunting, up 6.9%. The oil services company said it has increased its final dividend by 5% despite its pretax profit falling in 2014 due to impairment charges. The energy services company reported revenue of USD1.38 billion, a significant rise from GBP1.29 billion reported a year earlier. The rise came from its well completion and well intervention units, partially offset by a fall in revenue from its well construction unit.\n-------\nFTSE 250 LOSERS\n-------\nCobham, down 3.0%. The aerospace and defence manufacturer reported a big fall in pretax profit for 2014 despite higher revenue, as the company's results were held back by restructuring and acquisition costs. Cobham said its pretax profit for the year was GBP24 million, sharply down from the GBP127 million it posted a year earlier due to costs related to the acquisition of US communications equipment maker Aeroflex and restructuring measures.\nDomino Printing Sciences, down 1.9%, and Kennedy Wilson Europe Real Estate, down 1.7%. The companies have gone ex-dividend.\n-------\nAIM ALL-SHARE WINNERS\n-------\nCAP-XX, up 23%. The maker of thin-form supercapacitors that extend the performance of batteries reported a narrowed loss for the first half of its financial year, and said it has raised an estimated GBP1.1 million in a share placing and subscription, money it will use to reduce production costs and invest in product development. The company said it had raised gross proceeds of GBP1.2 million, or an estimated GBP1.1 million net of expenses, through a placing and subscription of 120 million shares at 1 pence each. The fundraising needs to be approved by shareholders.\nAurasian Minerals, up 21%. The company said Chairman Tony Shearer has stepped down and has been replaced by Bruce Kay.\nNorthern Petroleum, up 11%. The company said it has sold an 80% stake in the company's Cascina Alberto permit in Italy to a subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell. Under the terms of the deal, Shell will become the operator of the permit and pay Northern Petroleum a total of USD850,000 for the 80% stake. Northern Petroleum will retain the remaining 20% stake in the permit.\nBotswana Diamonds, up 9.2%. The company said it has recommenced exploration work in Orapa, Botswana with its joint venture partner Alrosa. A joint team from both companies have restarted exploration work on three blocks with the aim of finding major new kimberlites, an igneous rock that is associated with containing diamonds.\n-------\nAIM ALL-SHARE LOSERS\n-------\nWilliam Sinclair Holdings, off 22%. The maker of horticulture brands like J Arthur Bower as well as industrial lightweight aggregates said its Chief Executive was leaving and it was set to report annual results that will be materially worse than the previous year. The company has appointed a new CEO who is a turnaround specialist and has launched a transformation plan that it will continue to develop over coming weeks.\n-------\nBy Neil Thakrar; neilthakrar@alliancenews.com; @NeilThakrar1\nCopyright 2015 Alliance News Limited.

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\nBy Jonathan Stempel\nWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Saturday said fourth-quarter profit rose 32 percent, helped by improved results in its insurance operations and higher gains from investments and derivatives.\nNet income rose to $5.48 billion, or $3,333 per Class A share, from $4.16 billion, or $2,529 per share, a year earlier.\nQuarterly operating profit rose 18 percent to $4.67 billion, or $2,843 per share, from $3.96 billion, or $2,412 per share.\nAnalysts on average had forecast operating profit of $2,814 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 7 percent to $51.82 billion.\nBook value per share, which reflects assets minus liabilities and which Buffett considers a good yardstick for Berkshire's intrinsic worth, rose 3 percent from the end of September, to $155,501.\nFor all of 2015, profit rose 21 percent to $24.08 billion, or $14,656 per share. The gain from the merger that created Kraft Heinz Co prevented profit from edging lower, Berkshire said. Operating profit rose 5 percent to $17.36 billion, or $10,564 per share.\nBuffett, 85, has run Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire for nearly 51 years. He has transformed it from a failing textile company into a conglomerate with roughly 90 businesses in such areas as insurance, railroads, energy, food, apparel and real estate.\nBuffett's largest-ever acquisition, the $32 billion purchase of industrial parts maker Precision Castparts Corp, closed last month. It ended the year with $71.73 billion of cash.\nBerkshire expects on Monday to close its acquisition of Procter & Gamble Co's Duracell battery business, in exchange for P&G shares that Berkshire now owns.\nQuarterly profit from insurance operations rose 25 percent to $1.34 billion, as improvement in reinsurance offset higher claims payouts in the Geico auto insurance unit.\nBerkshire said gains from investments and derivatives quadrupled to $805 million. This in part reflected profits on stock sales and gains on long-term options contracts whose value is tied to the performance of the stock market.\nProfit at the BNSF railroad unit fell 9 percent to $1.08 billion, reflecting lower demand, especially in coal and some industrial products, as oil prices fell.\nBuffett said BNSF's profit could decline further in 2016.\nBerkshire's insurance units ended 2015 with $87.7 billion of float, the amount of premiums held before claims are paid, Buffett said. Berkshire uses float to help fund acquisitions and other investments.\nThe company has well over $100 billion of equity investments.\nBerkshire said it plans to keep its big stake in IBM Corp despite a $2.6 billion paper loss as of Dec. 31.\nIn Friday trading, Berkshire's Class A shares closed at $198,190.50, and its Class B shares closed at $131.92. Both are nearly unchanged this year.\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Nick Zieminski and Leslie Adler)\nNext In Money\n",

REUTERS/Stefan Wermuth\nBy James Davey | LONDON\nLONDON Britain's Sainsbury's expressed confidence in outperforming its supermarket peers and played down the threat posed by recovering rival Tesco on Tuesday, although it said no quick improvement in tough trading conditions was expected.\nSainsbury's in common with rivals Tesco, Asda and Morrisons, is grappling with food price deflation and an intensifying price war launched to counter discounters Aldi and Lidl.\nThey are also having to adapt as consumers shop more frequently, buy more online and shop locally rather than at out-of-town stores.\nSainsbury's posted a fifth consecutive quarter of declining underlying sales but it said measures laid out in November's strategic update were working, enabling it to combat the discounters' threat and Tesco, whose turnaround under new boss Dave Lewis appears to be gathering pace.\nShares in Sainsbury's, down 14 percent over the last year, were up 1.3 percent at 272 pence at 0952 GMT. Tesco shares were down 0.9 percent.\nSainsbury's is cutting costs, dividends and new store openings to fund an extra 150 million pounds ($222 million) in lower prices. It is also investing in improving the quality of its products and expanding its non-food, online and convenience business.\n\"I’ve competed with Tesco my entire career. The important thing for us is to focus on doing what we do,\" CEO Mike Coupe told reporters.\n\"We’re confident in the plan that we set out to execute. And the stuff that we’ve done so far seems to be pointing in the right direction.\"\nHe noted that where the firm has cut prices it has seen average volume growth of more than 3 percent. Sales at convenience stores were up 14 percent, while online grocery order numbers and sales were up 14 percent and 6 percent, respectively.\nHowever, some analysts remain unconvinced.\n\"It feels to us that it could be particularly negatively impacted by a sustained better out-turn from Tesco UK, making  Coupe’s assertion that Sainsbury will outperform its peers all the more interesting,\" said Shore Capital analyst Clive Black.\nSainsbury's sales at stores open more than a year fell 1.9 percent, excluding fuel, in the 10 weeks to March 14, its fiscal fourth quarter. That was in line with company guidance and follows a third-quarter fall of 1.7 percent.\n\"We expect the market to remain challenging for the foreseeable future.

The cut, which marks British Gasâ€™ second gas price reduction in six months, is expected to lower annual energy bills by Â£35 on average. However, energy experts have claimed that Britain's biggest energy supplier should slash prices further as wholesale costs have now been low for over a year.\nUSwitch consumer policy director Ann Robinson accused British Gas of 'short-changing' its customers and said since it is the biggest energy provider in the country, it should set an example for other suppliers to follow. She said, as quoted by the Guardian today: â€œAlthough the price cut is welcome, I wanted them to do far more and almost shame the other companies into taking action. But instead we get a price cut that is far smaller than it should be. It short-changes their customers and lets the other suppliers off the hook.â€� In response, a British Gas spokesperson said the company always cut prices as much as it could.\nThe news come after earlier this month, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) revealed that the UKâ€™s â€˜Big Sixâ€™ energy suppliers which also include blue-chip peer SSE (LON:SSE), as well as ScottishPower, E.On, EDF and nPower, had overcharged households by around Â£1.2 billion each year between 2009-2013. The competition watchdog is due to publish the full report from its investigation into the UK energy supply market by the end of the year.\nShares in British Gas owner Centrica have been trading higher today.

  "articleText" : "Merkel ally says Europe needs bigger competitor to U.S rivals\nGerman lawmakers support hinges on protecting Frankfurt hub\nShare on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government is leaning toward supporting the proposed fusion of Deutsche Boerse AG with London Stock Exchange Group Plc to create a European powerhouse that could better compete with bigger U.S. rivals, government officials said.\nMerkel’s government sees the combination as a way for Deutsche Boerse to grow and avoid being left on the sideline should other exchanges decide to merge, said the officials, who asked not be identified discussing the private deliberations. Key to setting aside reservations that Germany may have will be ensuring that German business interests are protected in the final deal, they said.\nThe combined entity, to be run by Deutsche Boerse Chief Executive Officer Carsten Kengeter, would locate its holding company in London, while continuing to operate markets from their present locations, the companies said last week. The proposed deal spurred Intercontinental Exchange Inc., owner of the New York Stock Exchange, to consider jumping into the mix with a competing offer for the LSE.\n“Europe needs a big exchange which is internationally competitive, especially with the U.S., so I’m fully supportive,” said Michael Fuchs, a deputy chairman of Merkel’s Christian Democrats. “It’s not surprising that the U.S. is now showing interest in a merger with the LSE as they have to fear that Europe will have a very big exchange.”\nThe federal government’s ability to influence the outcome is primarily through political pressure. Official approval lies with the exchange regulator in Hesse, the state where Deutsche Boerse is based and which is governed by Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union. Hesse’s Economy Ministry said last week it’s too early to say whether the deal will be approved and that the state’s exchange supervisor will examine whether the merger would be detrimental to Frankfurt. Steffen Seibert, Merkel’s chief spokesman, declined to comment on the merger, saying it was a business decision.\nBrexit Vote\nThe talks are complicated by the U.K.’s potential exit from the European Union, which could throw treaties and regulatory frameworks into question. The vote on whether to stay in the 28-nation bloc is scheduled for June 23.\nThe two European exchanges said discussions are ongoing to combine into a global player worth at least 20 billion pounds ($28 billion), based on the closing share price of the two the day before the deal was announced, that could compete with ICE and Chicago-based CME Group, the world’s largest derivatives market. LSE said Tuesday it hasn’t received a proposal from ICE.\n“Capital market access is crucial for the strong German real economy,” Carsten Schneider, deputy parliamentary leader of Merkel’s Social Democrat coalition partner, said in an e-mailed statement to Bloomberg. “A major European stock exchange which is not a takeover target finds my general political support.”\nWhile the government is inclined to support the deal, lawmakers say they won’t just give it a green light. SPD lawmaker Ingrid Arndt-Brauer, head of the Finance Committee in the lower house of parliament, told Bloomberg on Feb. 23 that Germany should question the motives behind the planned merger, threatening to withdraw her support if it only served as a “safety net” for London in the case of an EU exit.\nAlexander Radwan, a lawmaker from the Bavarian sister party to Merkel’s CDU who sits on parliament’s finance committee, said he doubts a decision will be made before the U.K. referendum, given regulatory differences between the countries and uncertainty over the vote’s outcome. Germany must weigh the drawbacks for Frankfurt as the country’s financial hub, he said.\n\"On the one hand, we have an interest in a strong exchange in a European sense that can compete globally,\" Radwan said in a phone interview. \"On the other hand, the savings banks rightly criticize having the seat of the holding in London because that’s where decisions on future business will be made.\"\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

  "articleText" : "Former Tesco bosses face 10 years in jail if found guilty of SFO fraud charges\nTesco has been investigated by the Serious Fraud Office for the past two years\nAshley Armstrong , Retail Correspondent\n9 September 2016 • 1:58pm\nThe Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has charged a trio of former Tesco directors with fraud linked to the £263m accounting black hole which rocked the supermarket two years ago.\nChris Bush , who ran the grocer’s UK business, was charged alongside former UK finance director Carl Rogberg and former food director John Scouler in the first raft of charges since the SFO began its investigation into the supermarket chain in 2014.\nEach man has been charged with fraud by abuse of position and fraud by false accounting, which can lead to prison sentences of up to 10 and seven years respectively.\nAll three were part of the so-called “Cheshunt Eight” who were suspended from Tesco in late November 2014 after the supermarket was found to have inflated its profits by booking income from its suppliers too early. The fate of the other five is unknown.\nThe accounting scandal engulfed Tesco in the biggest crisis in its history, with £1.6bn wiped off the company’s share price within hours of the supermarket admitting in September 2014 that it had overstated income from its suppliers.\nThe discovery came just 22 days after Dave Lewis took over from Philip Clarke as chief executive of the company in an effort to reinvigorate falling sales and profits at the retailer.\nAfter a whistleblower alerted Mr Lewis, a team of forensic accountants from Deloitte established that Tesco had artificially inflated its half-year profits.\nRichard Broadbent, former chairman, fell on his sword a month later after Tesco revealed that the black hole was larger than originally expected.\nThe accounting scandal prompted Tesco to post the biggest ever loss in UK corporate history\nThe admission sparked investigations by authorities including the Serious Fraud Office, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) and the Groceries Code Adjudicator (GCA) and led to Tesco reporting its biggest ever loss of £6.4bn for the year to February 2015.\nThe SFO opened its investigation into the Tesco scandal in October 2014 and has said it will conclude its inquiry by the end of this year.\nThe fact that the investigation remains open means Mr Clarke could still be charged.\nThe former chief executive was interviewed under caution by the SFO as part of the inquiry, along with Kevin Grace, Tesco’s former group commercial director.\nThe SFO could also yet bring charges against the company under a US-style “deferred prosecution agreement” (DPA), which requires high court approval, and could see it pay a sizeable fine. Analysts have suggested this could be as much as £500m.\nBritain’s biggest retailer also faces a huge damages claim from investors, who allege they have lost tens of millions of pounds because of the accounting scandal.\nA Tesco spokesman said: “We note the decision of the SFO to bring a prosecution against former colleagues in relation to historic issues and acknowledge the investigation into the company is ongoing. Tesco continues to cooperate with the SFO’s investigation.\n“The last two years have seen an extensive programme of change at Tesco, but given this is an ongoing legal matter, we are unable to provide any further comment at this time.”\nCredit: Simon Dawson\nDespite the ongoing criminal investigation, Mr Scouler joined telecommunications group TalkTalk in March 2015 after being hired by Dido Harding, who had worked with him at Tesco.\nMr Scouler was yesterday placed on sabbatical by the telecoms company.\nRoss Dixon, of Hickman & Rose, acting for Mr Bush, said his client was “extremely disappointed by this decision”.\n“He is not guilty and from the outset has fully cooperated with both Tesco and the SFO in their investigations,” Mr Dixon said.  “He will vigorously contest these allegations and is confident he will be cleared of any wrongdoing.”\nThe three men are due to appear before Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Sept 22.\nThe FRC, the accounting watchdog,  last week dropped its investigation into Tesco’s former chief financial officer Laurie McIlwee. Mr McIlwee left his job in April 2014 with a £1m payoff following tensions with then chief executive Mr Clarke.\nThe FRC’s inquiry into PricewaterhouseCoopers, Tesco’s auditor at the time of the profit overstatement, remains ongoing.  The GCA found in January that Tesco had falsely inflated its profits by knowingly delaying and deducting millions of pounds from its suppliers.\nThe supermarket also charged its suppliers twice for sums owed in order to improve its own financial position.\nSince taking the helm, Mr Lewis has apologised publicly for Tesco’s actions and rewritten the company’s treatment of suppliers, including a commitment to pay its smaller partners within 14 days, compared to the industry standard of 28 days. In an effort to shore up Tesco’s balance sheet Mr Lewis has offloaded its South Korean operations for £4.2bn and refocused the company’s attention on its core UK supermarkets by shedding assets including coffee chain Harris & Hoole, Giraffe and Euphorium Bakeries. \nShares in Tesco closed 5.05p, or 3pc, lower at 166.05p yesterday, having lost more than half of their value in the past three years. \n",

Photograph: Matt Cardy/Getty Images\nTuesday 12 April 2016 13.01 BST\nLast modified on Tuesday 12 April 2016 13.39 BST\nClose\nThis article is 8 months old\nTesco has agreed to sell half its stake in Lazada, a south-east Asian online retailer, to China’s Alibaba for about £90m as the UK supermarket group concentrates on its home business.\nTesco said it would sell 8.6% of Lazada to Alibaba, the world’s largest retailer, for $129m (£90.6m) in a deal valuing the business at $1.5bn. Alibaba will invest $500m in new Lazada shares as well as buying out Tesco and other investors in the Singapore-based retailer.\nTesco will retain an 8.3% stake in Lazada after the transaction completes, including the issue of new shares, but Alibaba will have an option to buy out remaining investors within 12 to 18 months.\nThe deal values Tesco’s Lazada stake at significantly more than the £113m carrying value listed in its accounts last August. Tesco, which reports its annual results on Wednesday, classified Lazada as an asset available for sale for the financial year that ended in February.\nTesco results: analysts expect strong start to the year\nRead more\nThe former Tesco chief executive Philip Clarke bought 19.6% of Lazada in November 2013 as the grocer sought to improve its online capabilities in Asia. It has invested $124m in the business. Under new management after a series of profit warnings, Tesco has retrenched to overhaul its UK stores and has been selling international operations such as its business in South Korea .\nAlibaba, which sells almost 1bn consumer products, has overtaken Tesco and Walmart of the US to become the world’s biggest retailer. It is expanding beyond China , where it makes about 90% of revenue, and wants to tap into fast-growing south-east Asian consumer markets such as Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand.\nMichael Evans, Alibaba’s president, said: “Globalisation is a critical strategy for the growth of Alibaba today and well into the future. With the investment in Lazada, Alibaba gains access to a platform with a large and growing consumer base outside China, a proven management team and a solid foundation for future growth in one of the most promising regions for ecommerce globally.”\nThe deal will take Alibaba into a region where no single operator yet dominates. While south-east Asia’s growing affluence is expected to fuel growth in online shopping, many countries in the region lack transport and payments systems required for online retailing to take off.\nTesco said it would use the money from the sale for general working capital purposes.\n",

REUTERS/Stefan Wermuth/Files\n2/3\nleft\nright\nA Barclays bank office is seen at Canary Wharf  in London, Britain May 19, 2015. REUTERS/Suzanne Plunkett\n3/3\nBy Matt Scuffham and Sinead Cruise | LONDON\nLONDON Barclays (BARC.L) Chairman John McFarlane has fired the British bank's chief executive after he had lost the support of non-executive directors in a clash over style and the pace of the bank's turnaround.\nThe move comes just three months after McFarlane joined the bank and three years after Antony Jenkins was promoted to CEO, having been the bank's retail chief. McFarlane, who had signalled his intention to speed up Barclays' turnaround efforts when he took the post in April, will assume executive duties until a permanent successor is appointed.\nMcFarlane said on a conference call on Wednesday he had spoken to Jenkins last week about his position after independent directors of the bank complained to him about the CEO's leadership style.\nNicknamed \"Saint Antony\" for his drive to clean up the group's culture after an interest rate-fixing scandal, Jenkins' understated approach, in contrast to the brash style of his predecessor Bob Diamond, rubbed board members up the wrong way.\nJenkins' position was also undermined by a row with the boss of Barclays' investment bank, Tom King, over the future of the business.\nJenkins wanted to slash the investment bank's assets more aggressively, according to a person familiar with the matter, but King resisted saying he would retire early from the bank if such a strategy was pursued.\nThe source said that McFarlane intervened to ensure that King would stay and that the disagreement appeared to have undermined Jenkins's position.\nReuters could not immediately reach Jenkins for comment. King declined to comment.\nJenkins' exit, which will be soothed with a payoff of more than 2 million pounds ($3 million), was confirmed at a board meeting late on Tuesday.\nBarclays is the fourth major European bank to change CEO this year. Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), Credit Suisse CSGN.VX and Standard Chartered (STAN.L) also named new leaders amid investor disquiet over low share prices and stubbornly high costs.\nAlthough shares in Barclays have underperformed rivals since Jenkins' appointment in August 2012, he was expected by many analysts to be given longer to implement a turnaround strategy involving the divestment of non-core assets, improving returns and cutting costs.\n\"The announcement came as a surprise ... but was not completely unexpected, with returns from the investment banking division still disappointing. The chairman comes with a good reputation and I would back him in his decision,\" said David Smith, co-manager of Henderson High Income fund, which has a stake in Barclays.\nThe investment bank's performance improved in the first quarter as volatility drove trading, but revenue rose just 2 percent, less than Wall Street rivals such as Goldman Sachs (GS.N).\nShares in Britain's third-biggest bank by market value closed up 2 percent at 260 pence, having dropped the previous session to a two-month low.\nThe move echoes McFarlane's actions at insurer Aviva (AV.L), where he took over the full-time running of the insurer in May 2012 having delivered a damning assessment of Chief Executive Andrew Moss's five years in charge.\nWarning signs were evident when McFarlane highlighted the poor performance of Barclays shares in a letter to shareholders after joining the bank in April.\nShares in Barclays are trading at just 0.7 times the value of the bank's assets. In comparison, British rival Lloyds (LLOY.L), which only has a small investment banking business, is trading at 1.3 times.\nMcFarlane said under Jenkins shareholder value creation had been pushed \"too far into the future\". He said the bank was in no rush to appoint a successor and the most important thing was to find the right person, adding it would be good to find someone familiar with investment banking.\nINVESTMENT BANKERS WELCOME MOVE\nThe 68-year-old Scot faces a host of challenges as the British bank grapples with regulatory pressures, such as a demand to separate domestic retail banking operations from riskier investment banking operations, while trying to improve its overall performance.\nJenkins' successor will be tasked with accelerating the run-down of Barclays' non-core assets. The bank also needs to resolve allegations over alleged past misconduct, while bringing returns back above its cost of capital and deciding how big to keep its investment banking operation.\nOne senior Barclays executive said the move was seen positively by its investment bankers, noting McFarlane had recently told staff of his commitment to the business. Jenkins had presided over cuts to the investment banking operations involving hundreds of job losses.\n\"It's the best possible public message that we could have wished for. He got rid of the guy who was questioning this,\" said the executive, speaking on condition of anonymity.\nWith his background in retail banking, Jenkins had little affinity with Barclays' investment bankers and McFarlane indicated his successor will need to have a more established track record in investment banking.\nHe also emphasized the importance of the investment bank in Barclays' strategy, seeming to rule out any chance of Barclays exiting it altogether.\n\"It will be good to have someone that has some familiarity with the investment banking business as it's such an important part of the business,\" McFarlane said.\nCandidates to replace Jenkins could include Finance Director Tushar Morzaria, appointed in July 2013 having been chief financial officer of JP Morgan Chase’s (JPM.N) corporate and investment banking division.\nMorzaria has struck up a strong relationship with McFarlane, according to industry sources.\nAnother internal candidate could be Jonathan Moulds, the former Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC.N) executive who was appointed to the newly created role of chief operating officer in January.\n(Additional reporting by Steve Slater, Nishant Kumar, Sinead Cruise, Simon Jessop and Paul Sandle; Editing by David Holmes and Susan Fenton)\nNext In Business News\n",

That’s what Warren Buffett’s company paid, on average, to accumulate its stake in the iPhone maker, according to a recent regulatory filing that gives fresh details on the investment.\nThe company purchased 9.81 million shares of Apple in the days through March 14 for about $976 million, Berkshire’s Geico unit said in a document for insurance regulators. A May filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission showed that Buffett’s company owned that number of shares as of March 31, without detailing the cost of the purchases or the month in which they were acquired.\nThe holding was initiated by one of Buffett’s investment managers, Todd Combs or Ted Weschler. Though the billionaire’s deputies may deviate from his well-known avoidance of technology stocks, they tend to follow his deeper ideas about investing, including buying stocks at prices where they believe there’s a “margin of safety” -- or a buffer against losses.\nWhen Berkshire bought Apple, the shares had slumped amid a slowdown in iPhone sales. The rebound that Berkshire is counting on is yet to materialize, however. Shares fell 2.3 percent to $95.33 on Friday in New York.\nBuffett didn’t respond to a message seeking comment.\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.\n",

Compulsory redundancies will always be a last resort.\"\nIt said recognised unions Accord and Unite were consulted prior to the announcement and will continue to be consulted.\nRob MacGregor, Unite's National Officer for Finance, said the bank had committed to providing alternative jobs, voluntary redundancy and voluntary job swapping to those employees affected where possible.\n\"We will make sure the bank keep to these commitments, while continuing to consult and support our members,\" he said in a statement.\nLloyds was rescued with a 20.5 billion pound taxpayer-funded bailout during the 2007-09 financial crisis, leaving the state holding 43 percent. The government has since reduced its holding to less than 10 percent, raising around 16 billion pounds for the public purse.\nThe bank reported weaker than expected third-quarter results last month, and set aside another 500 million pounds to compensate customers mis-sold loan insurance, bringing its total compensation bill to nearly 14 billion pounds, more than double that of any other bank.\nThe government is planning to sell at least 2 billion pounds worth of shares in Lloyds next spring and return the bank to full private ownership.

Credit: Alamy\nEmily Gosden , Energy Editor\n18 February 2016 • 10:45pm\nBritain faces a \"looming gap\" in its energy supplies because of a series of failures in the Government’s scheme to keep the lights on, British Gas owner Centrica has warned.\nMinisters must make \"significant changes\" to their  capacity market, which pays power stations to guarantee their availability,  in order to push the subsidy high enough to secure investment in new gas plants, it said.\nThe current scheme overestimates how much wind power may be available, given there will be \"zero\" when the wind doesn’t blow, and procures insufficient reliable power plant capacity, the energy giant said.\nCentrica issued the warning as it reported annual results in line with expectations and reassured investors that it could \"more than pay\" for its dividend – which it cut by 30pc last year – even at current low commodity prices. Shares rose almost 7pc on the news.\nProfits at the  British Gas household energy supply business rose by 31pc to £574m last year , despite the company twice cutting gas prices.\nIain Conn, Centrica chief executive Credit: Fiona Hanson/PA Wire\nConsumer groups claimed the increase showed that the supplier, which announced another price cut last week , had made only \"paltry\" reductions and could afford to cut prices further and faster.\nIain Conn, Centrica chief executive, insisted it had passed on \"all the impact of falling gas prices\" so far, but said there would be scope for further price cuts if costs remained low.\nThe rising profits reflected a 5pc increase in household gas consumption in colder weather, and lower costs for implementing a Government energy efficiency scheme, he said.\nCentrica has said it wants to focus on the British Gas, customer-facing business Credit: PA Wire\nCentrica group operating profits fell by 12pc to £1.5bn in what Mr Conn said was a \"very challenging year\" due to lower oil and gas prices.\nOn a pre-tax basis, Centrica reported a loss for the second year running, after booking £2.3bn of write-downs related to the North Sea and its share in the UK's nuclear fleet.\nMr Conn said he had warned the Government it must reform its capacity market scheme to get subsidies \"up to a level where it encourages new investment\" as prices were currently too low for investors to build new plants.\nThe scheme offers fossil fuel and nuclear power plant owners retainer-style payments totalling more than £800m a year to guarantee their availability in future years.\nIt is intended to help ensure there is enough reliable capacity to keep the lights on, as the expansion of subsidised renewables undercuts the economics of conventional generation.\nAs a result, \"there is a looming gap for 2018-19 winter period\", Mark Hanafin, head of Centrica’s energy production business, said.\nMark Hanafin, Centrica head of energy production\n\"Investors are going to need to see significant changes to the way the capacity market is being operated,\" he said.\nMore capacity needed to be secured further in advance, especially as the scheme assumed Britain’s wind farms would produce 15pc of their capacity. \"That’s fine if the wind is blowing. If the wind’s not blowing, it’s not 15pc, it’s zero,\" he said.\nCentrica also wants existing plants to be awarded three-year rather than one-year contracts. Mr Conn said it was \"not sufficient\" to encourage companies \"just to limp along and keep their plant running for an extra year\".\nCentrica is not currently investing in any new power plant capacity in the UK, despite having an option for a 1GW new gas plant at King’s Lynn.\nIt is also considering upgrading a mothballed old 370MW plant at the same site, but failed to secure a capacity market contract for the project.\nThe Department of Energy and Climate Change has already said it is reviewing the design of the scheme.\nA spokesman for the DECC said: \"We are clear that providing secure, affordable energy for our families and businesses is non-negotiable.\n\"The capacity market is driving down costs and securing energy at the lowest possible price for bill-payers, but we are not complacent which is why we will review it to ensure it can deliver an energy infrastructure fit for the 21st century.\"\n",

The CRL does not require the generation of new clinical data.\"\nA spokesman said the company hoped to resolve the matter in a \"timely\" manner.\nBerenberg analysts said AstraZeneca would probably face a six-month review once it refiled with the FDA. \"Assuming the company can refile in a matter of months, an approval in Q1 2017 could be possible,\" they wrote in a note.\nThe setback offset positive news from a clinical trial testing Faslodex in breast cancer, which may boost sales of that medicine.\nBuying ZS Pharma was one of several bolt-on acquisitions by AstraZeneca designed to help build up its pipeline of new drugs.\nZS-9 treats hyperkalaemia, or high potassium levels, which is typically associated with chronic kidney disease and chronic heart failure.

  "articleText" : "Market News | Thu Feb 5, 2015 | 5:50am EST\nOil majors fail to find reserves to counter falling output\n* Oil groups produced much more than they found last year\n* Oil and gas output fell in 2014, echoes trend over past decade\n* Graphic on oil majors' output: link.reuters.com/huh93w\n* Companies now making investment cuts to counter low oil prices\nBy Tom Bergin and Ron Bousso\nLONDON, Feb 5 Big oil companies had a poor record of finding and producing oil and gas last year, according to figures out in the past week - and big cuts in spending in response to falling crude prices could undermine their plans to turn that around.\nFour of the world's six biggest oil firms by market value - Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron, BP and ConocoPhillips - released provisional figures showing together they replaced only two-thirds of the hydrocarbons they extracted in 2014 with new reserves.\nCombined, those four and industry leader Exxon Mobil  posted an average drop in oil and gas production of 3.25 percent last year.\nAll predict their output will increase and new reserves will be added in coming years. But the 2014 results echo longer-term trends.\nOver the past decade, the biggest Western oil companies have seen reserves growth stall, production drop 15 percent and profits fall by almost a fifth - even as oil prices almost doubled, a Reuters analysis of corporate filings shows.\nAnalysts and industry executives have blamed the sector's anaemic performance in that period, in part, on companies' approach to spending on new fields and infrastructure, tending to ramp it up when oil prices rise and cut when prices plummet, such as in the late 1990s and after the 2008 financial crisis.\nThe latest collapse has seen prices halve since June. In recent months, the biggest oil groups on both sides of the Atlantic have announced sharp cuts in capital expenditure (capex) out as far as 2017, as they seek to preserve cash to maintain dividends.\nInvestors have largely welcomed the focus on dividends. But some say the cuts could come back to bite the industry.\n\"Capex can't be cut forever. Cuts in capex are only storing up problems for the sector down the road,\" said Will Riley, fund manager with the Guinness Global Energy Fund, which holds shares in many of the big U.S. and European oil firms.\nThe ability of oil companies to replace reserves has not been as much of a concern for some executives and investors in recent years due to the shale oil boom.\nBut the high cost of extracting shale oil makes doing so profitably a challenge where prices are low - making traditional and less expensive reserves more relevant in a downturn.\nLOST OPPORTUNITIES\nBP and Chevron have announced around 13 percent cuts in capex for 2015, while ConocoPhillips last week upped its planned reductions in spending for 2015 to 33 percent. Shell and Exxon have not issued budget plans yet.\n\"We have to prioritise cash flow instead of growth for the time being,\" Gerhard Roiss, chief executive of Vienna-based oil producer OMV AG, said last week as he announced an around 30 percent reduction in investment in new projects.\nOil executives play down worries about the sector's fundamental health. They say lower production reflects an increased focus on returns, rather than output for its own sake, while falling reserves figures can be misleading.\n\"These (2014) reserve replacement numbers are a little lumpy ... I am not too alarmed about this year's down(turn),\" BP boss Bob Dudley told reporters this week.\nHowever, even executives accept that excessive pruning of investments can cost them barrels and profits in the long term.\n\"Many of the things that you may do out of excessive prudence basically means that you lose them (the opportunities). They won't come back anymore,\" Shell CEO Ben van Buerden told investors last week.\nVan Buerden said he would cut less than rivals to ensure he did not crimp Shell's long-term prospects. Similarly, Exxon told investors on Monday that while it would monitor spending closely, it would not \"forego any attractive opportunities\".\nNonetheless, Shell has shelved projects and put off $15 billion of spending it might have committed to over the next three years. Analysts at Jefferies predict Exxon will announce a 13 percent drop in capex when it presents its strategy plans in March.\nMartijn Rats, head of oil companies research at Morgan Stanley in London, said in a research note this week that overly aggressive cuts could have long-term repercussions.\nThe expertise needed to develop new fields and infrastructure takes long periods to build up, he said. Hence, if companies lose this expertise, they may struggle to expand their portfolios when oil prices recover.\nDEPLETION\nExecutives say the risk is not only that companies may lose future growth opportunities but also that existing reserves may not be fully exploited.\nProduction from oil fields falls over time, because reservoir pressure drops as oil is extracted. Fields on average experience natural depletion rates of around 15 percent per year, industry executives say, but companies generally reduce this to 3-5 percent by sinking additional wells, injecting gas or by using other capital-intensive techniques.\nCutting capex will increase depletion rates, if past experience is an indicator.\n\"That is a growing risk for the industry. If you go back to the 2008 and 2009 period ... we saw an increase worldwide in decline rates for all companies, basically for the entire industry, increase by a percent or two. And that's very significant,\" Chevron CEO John Watson told investors last week.\nUsing data going back to the oil drop in the mid 1980s, analysts at Bernstein calculated the rise in depletion rates was 3 percentage points within two years after an oil price collapse began.\nAcross the industry, this could mean the loss of hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil production each day.\nSome investors and analysts say companies could yet use the downturn to help build long-term reserves and production.\nPaul Mumford, fund manager with Cavendish Asset Management, said lower oil prices and a drop in drilling activity was leading to downward pressure on the prices firms which sell construction and drilling services to oil majors charge. This could encourage some companies to drill and build more, he said.\nAnd Charles Whall, fund manager with Investec, said stronger companies should consider replacing reserves through acquisitions.\nMorgan Stanley's Rats added: \"Sometimes, the best projects are done at the bottom of the cycle.\"\n(Additional reporting by Dmitry Zhdannikov; Editing by Pravin Char)\nNext In Market News\nAnti-pipeline protesters told to leave North Dakota camp area by Dec. 5\nCANNON BALL, N.D., Nov 26 Protesters opposed to an oil pipeline planned to run beneath a lake near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation in North Dakota must vacate an area where thousands of demonstrators have been camped by Dec. 5 or face prosecution, according to U.S. authorities.\n",

REUTERS/Yves Herman\nBy Philip Blenkinsop | BRUSSELS\nBRUSSELS Brewing giant Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR) plans to sell the eastern European assets of SABMiller SAB.L, which could fetch almost $8 billion, as it seeks European regulatory approval for its $100 billion-plus takeover of its closest rival.\nAB InBev has already lined up Japan's Asahi Group Holdings (2502.T) to buy SABMiller's Grolsch, Peroni and Meantime brands for 2.55 billion euros ($2.90 billion), and said on Friday it had put up for sale SABMiller's business in Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia.\nAB InBev, maker of Budweiser and Stella Artois, has barely any business in eastern Europe outside Russia and Ukraine, so analysts say the sale is more about preventing regulatory delays and exiting weak spots than ensuring market competition.\nBeer consumption in eastern Europe has been on the decline, due to shrinking populations, weak economies and tighter regulation. That makes the region much less attractive than the growth markets of Africa and Latin America that are driving what will be the biggest deal in consumer goods history.\n\"The eastern European markets may have provided an unwelcome and unnecessary distraction, and valuation notwithstanding, we regard this asset sale as a net positive\" for AB InBev, said Morningstar analyst Philip Gorham.\nHe estimates a sale could fetch $7.75 billion, based on a multiple of 11 times expected 2016 operating earnings of $705 million, with Carlsberg (CARLb.CO) the most likely buyer, though it might face antitrust constraints in Poland.\nMolson Coors (TAP.N) could have antitrust trouble buying the assets, following its purchase in 2013 of eastern Europe's StarBev from CVC Capital Partners [CVC.UL]. Heineken (HEIN.AS) might also face hurdles from competition regulators.\nBut SAB's business could be attractive to a private equity group or Asahi if it wanted further European expansion, analysts said.\nAB InBev has notified the European Commission, the European Union's antitrust regulator, which is set to deliver its verdict on the takeover of SAB by May 24.\nIf the Commission chose to open an in-depth investigation into the SAB deal, it would not receive clearance for up to 90 working days, a delay AB InBev may be keen to avoid.\nAB InBev said in a statement the sale included a number of top brands in local markets, such as Pilsner Urquell in Czech Republic and Dreher in Hungary. It said it expected considerable interest from potential buyers.\nThe sale is conditional on AB InBev concluding its purchase of SAB, expected in the second half of this year.\n(Additional reporting by Martinne Geller in London and Esha Vaish in Bengaluru; Editing by Jon Boyle and Mark Potter)\nNext In Deals\n",

  "articleText" : "CarlaMozee\nMarkets Reporter\nLONDON (MarketWatch) — U.K. stocks rallied Thursday, led by Tesco PLC, which rose after the company — which is Britain’s largest supermarket chain — laid out plans for a turnaround.\nBut Tesco’s gains didn’t extend to all retail stocks. Marks & Spencer PLC finished among the session’s few decliners.\nThe FTSE 100 UKX, +0.17%  surged 2.3% to 6,526.41, the strongest rise since Dec. 16, according to FactSet data, with only five companies trading lower. The shares were pushed to session highs as European stocks SXXP, +0.18%   were driven higher on the prospect of further monetary stimulus in the eurozone.\nStocks held to gains after the Bank of England kept its key lending rate at a record low of 0.5% and left the size of its bond-buying program at 375 billion pounds ($567 billion), as expected. The pound GBPUSD, +0.2088% had been little changed against the dollar after the announcement, but later gained some ground to trade at $1.5109 versus $1.511 on Wednesday.\nTopping the FTSE 100 was Tesco TSCO, +0.33% whose stock shot up 15% in heavy volume, and closed above £2 for the first time since late September. The supermarket chain said it plans to close 43 unprofitable stores, sell off assets and cut prices as well as not pay a final dividend. Same-store sales, excluding gasoline, fell 2.9% in the 19 weeks to Jan. 3, a narrower-than-expected decline. The decline was an improvement from a 5.4% fall in the second quarter.\n“Tesco had a good Christmas” but that may not mark the start of a long-term turnaround in sales, wrote Louise Cooper, analyst at Cooper City, in a report Thursday. “The competitive pressures remain intense. It is interesting that Britons clearly were happy to spend more at Tesco over the special period that is Christmas. But now that the festive period is over, I think they will return to their price-conscious ways.”\nInvestors also pushed up shares of rival supermarket chain J Sainsbury SBRY, +0.00% and Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC MRW, +0.27%  by 10% and 8%, respectively.\nShares of Talk Talk Telecom Group PLC TALK, +0.39%  rose 0.5% after the company said it purchased Tesco’s Blinkbox video-on-demand business for 5 million pounds ($7.6 million).\nBut holding at the bottom of the FTSE 100 was Marks & Spencer MKS, -0.24% Its shares fell 3.3% after the high-street retailer posted a fall in sales for the key Christmas period , stemming mainly from the general-merchandise portion of its business.

REUTERS/Luke MacGregor\nBy Toni Clarke\nGlaxoSmithKline Plc's drug to treat chronic breathing problems is safe and effective enough for adults with asthma to use but not adolescents, an advisory panel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration concluded on Thursday.\nThe panel voted 16-4 that Breo Ellipta should be approved for once daily treatment of asthma in adults 18 years and older. It voted 19-1 that the data did not support approval for use in children aged 12 to 17.\nThe FDA is not obliged to follow the advice of its advisory panels but typically does so. Glaxo licensed the product from Theravance Inc in 2002.\nThe drug consists of a corticosteroid, which reduces inflammation, and a long-acting beta-agonist, or LABA, called vilanterol, which is designed to open the airways.\nThe LABA class of drugs has been linked in the past with asthma-related deaths, though there were no asthma-related deaths in studies of Breo Ellipta reviewed by the FDA.\nTimothy Anderson, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein, said in a research report that children represent about 10 percent of the eligible population for the drug. Even so, the company's inability to market it for children \"will have certain commercial implications,\" he added.\nAnderson said insurance companies will need to include more than one LABA/corticosteorid on their formulary to meet the needs of the total asthma population, when most would prefer just one agent.\nIn addition, he said, competitors will be quick to rally behind a \"one drug meets all\" approach. He predicts $750 million in Breo sales in 2020.\nThe panel vote came after the U.S. market closed. Anderson said he expects Theravance stock to fall Friday morning to between $13-$15 a share from $17.97 on Thursday.\nThe panel recommended that a large safety trial be conducted similar to others being conducted for drugs in the same class, including Glaxo's Advair, AstraZeneca's Symbicort and Merck & Co's Dulera and Foradil, in both adolescents and adults.\nBreo Ellipta is an inhaled treatment that has already been approved to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, a condition that includes emphysema, chronic bronchitis, or both.\nDarrell Baker, head of Glaxo's global respiratory franchise, said the company's aim is to work with the FDA and \"answer any outstanding questions to enable them to make a fully informed decision.\"\nThe FDA is expected to rule on whether to approve the drug by April 30, 2015.\n(Reporting by Toni Clarke in Washington; Editing by Sandra Maler, Peter Cooney and David Gregorio)\nNext In Health News\n",

  "articleText" : "Money | Tue Oct 13, 2015 | 1:23pm EDT\nBarclays set to name former JPMorgan banker Staley as new CEO\nBy Lawrence Delevingne and Sinead Cruise | NEW YORK/LONDON\nNEW YORK/LONDON British bank Barclays PLC is close to naming former JPMorgan Chase banker Jes Staley as chief executive, signaling a renewed focus on an investment banking division that has been pared back over the past three years.\nBarclays offered the position to Staley, currently managing partner of U.S. hedge fund firm BlueMountain Capital Management, and he accepted the offer, a person with knowledge of the situation told Reuters.\nBoston-born James 'Jes' Staley, 58, ran JPMorgan's investment bank and asset management business and had been at the bank for 34 years before leaving in early 2013 to join BlueMountain. He made the shortlist when Barclays last looked for a CEO three years ago.\n\"His appointment will indicate a greater commitment to the IB (investment bank), but then Barclays' profitability problems are linked to the IB and not the traditional bank,\" said Chintan Joshi, analyst at Nomura.\nPrevious CEO Antony Jenkins was fired in July after losing the support of non-executive directors in a clash over style and the pace of the bank's turnaround.\nJenkins set about reducing the importance of the investment bank after a series of scandals, while changes in regulation also made many trading activities unprofitable. It was intended as a clear break from his predecessor Bob Diamond, another American investment banker.\nInvestors and analysts said Staley should improve morale and set a clear strategy for the investment bank after years of uncertainty, but they warned he should not build it back up aggressively.\n\"At first sight he would not appear to be the person to downsize the IB, but maybe that is too much of a snap reaction,\" said Richard Marwood, senior investment manager at Axa Investment Managers.A top 20 Barclays investor, who asked not to be named, said: \"We don't have a problem with them retaining some investment banking activities, it just needs to be done in a rational way ... given the volatility and reputational risk that comes with the investment bank, the bar needs to be set very high.\"\nBarclays shares were down 2.6 percent at 249.9 pence by 1340 GMT, underperforming a 2 percent fall by Europe's bank index.\nCHOPPY WATERS\nAny appointment would also still depend on Staley getting approval from Britain's financial regulators.\nThe appointment is expected to be announced in the next two weeks, according to the Financial Times, which first reported the expected hiring.\nA Bank of England spokeswoman said on Tuesday no-one had been approved yet as new Barclays CEO.\nBarclays said it noted the speculation regarding Staley but the process of appointing a new CEO \"has not yet concluded\".\n\"If this change is approved, it could signal that UK and U.S. regulators are comfortable with the renewed ascendancy of investment banking,\" said Jim Antos, analyst at Mizuho Securities Asia in Hong Kong.\nStaley, a keen yachtsman, joined JPMorgan in 1979 and spent eight years in its Brazilian business. He helped found its equities business and later became CEO of asset management.\nHe was long seen as a possible successor to JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, but was sidelined after a management reshuffle in 2012 and moved to BlueMountain a year later.\nStaley will face a number of challenges at Barclays.\nThe bank is just over halfway through a three-year plan to cut 19,000 jobs, including 7,000 in the investment bank, and it still faces litigation issues.\nIt needs to cut costs to improve returns, is trying to wind down 57 billion pounds of non-core assets, and needs to separate its domestic retail bank from more risky activities by 2019 to meet new regulations. Industry sources have said it has had more difficulty finalizing its \"ring-fencing\" plans than rivals.\nStaley, who also previously ran JPMorgan's private banking, may also look to fix Barclays' underperforming wealth management business.\nBarclays Chairman John McFarlane, who has been running the bank since Jenkins' exit, has also put more emphasis back on the investment bank and this week said European investment banks should consider merging to create a regional champion to compete with U.S. rivals, which are gaining market share.\nAn appointment of Staley would see a second former JPMorgan investment bank boss running a British bank, after Standard Chartered this year picked Bill Winters as its new CEO.\nBarclays' Finance Director Tushar Morzaria is another former JPMorgan executive, showing the growing influence of the U.S. bank's alumni in London.\n(Writing by Steve Slater; Additional reporting by Sangameswaran S, Aurindom Mukherjee and Lawrence White; Editing by Mark Potter and Keith Weir)\nJes Staley speaks during a panel discussion at the Institute of International Finance (IIF) annual meeting in Washington September 25, 2011.

Kingfisher, which trades as B&Q and Screwfix in Britain and Castorama and Brico Depot in France, further pledged to a capital return of Â£600 million over the next three years -- most likely via a share buyback -- in addition to the annual ordinary dividend.\nIn a statement ahead of the companyâ€™s capital markets day, CEO Veronique Laury said: \"With a clear roadmap now in place alongside clear long term targets, the size of the five year opportunity is significant. We do acknowledge the challenges ahead, however having already made good progress since March last year, and with 80,000 committed colleagues, we feel confident about our plan and look forward to moving on to the first year of our transformation.\"\nDespite Lauryâ€™s upbeat view, Kingfisherâ€™s share price slid as investors weighed the cost of the overhaul. The retailer has estimated that its plan, which entails improving its operational and online capabilities and driving efficiencies, would cost Â£800 million. The transformation will hit Kingfisherâ€™s profits by around Â£50 million in the first year and by about Â£70-100 million in the second year.\nAs of 08:36 GMT, Kingfisherâ€™s share price was 3.36 percent lower at 333.70p, making it the top faller on the FTSE 100 index, which meanwhile stood 0.07 percent higher at 5,904.12 points.\n",

  "articleText" : "Exposure to struggling emerging economies is prompting Standard Chartered Plc’s Chief Executive Officer Bill Winters to seek a “fundamental shift” in the business to steer the company to faster growth.\nIn an effort to restore profits after soaring bad loans in emerging markets hurt earnings, Winters\nrevealed plans to reduce positions in China and India, while expanding in large, fast-growing cities across developing nations. Standard Chartered, which generates almost all of its revenue in Asia, will restructure or exit $100 billion of assets after it reported an unexpected third-quarter loss of $139 million, compared with a profit of $1.5 billion a year earlier.\n“Do we believe that the opportunity in Asia has gone away as a result of the current period of adjustment in China, ASEAN, South Asia, Middle East, Africa, falling commodity prices, slower export growth, sluggish economies from the west? Absolutely not,” Winters said during a conference call on Tuesday. “Now with that said, we have to run our business between now and the time that these trends make themselves clear again.”\nWinters is seeking to reverse damage caused by predecessor Peter Sands’s revenue-driven expansion across emerging markets, which left the bank saddled with bad loans when commodity prices slumped and China’s economy started to slow. Under Sands, total assets more than doubled to $726 billion at the end of last year from 2006, with the bank using two previous rights issues to fund its growth in Asia.\nHere are some of the key points Winters and his Chief Financial Officer Andrew Nigel Halford made on the call with analysts and investors regarding Standard Chartered’s presence in emerging markets.\nKorea:\nThe retail and commercial business “a substantial underperformer” and “a real drag”\nPlans to restructure expensive voluntary retirement programs\nFocus on promotion of banking products through extensive retail network\nPracticality of exiting Korea “extremely difficult”\nChina:\nCut exposure 23 percent to $60 billion, considering “hard landing scenarios.”\nOf the $60 billion in exposure, $30 billion to $33 billion are in lending to financial institutions with 79 percent of that to top five Chinese banks.\nThe internationalization of the yuan will allow substantial investment opportunities with plans to double revenue from related client segments.\nCore position in mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and London as major yuan trading centers.\nIndia:\n“There are good opportunities there, but equally one needs to be very, very selective”\nReduced exposure by about 20 percent.\nIndonesia:\n“Fundamentally constructive” on the market despite economic challenges.\nLooking at portfolio optimization involving the lender’s 45 percent stake in PT Bank Permata, which it owns with conglomerate PT Astra International.\nAfrica:\nWhile stresses in the commodity-producing parts of the continent are “very clear,” long-term gross domestic product growth and economic opening provide opportunities to play on strengths in transaction banking.\nIncome growth will come from focus on core cities in major markets generating return on equity of more than 10 percent: five cities in India, seven cities in China, one in some of the African countries.\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

  "articleText" : "Reed Elsevier share price slides on underwhelming full-year results\nCompany to become RELX as part of effort to simplify structure\nby Xavier Basil Thursday, 26 Feb 2015, 14:33 GMT\nReed Elsevier Plc (LON:REL) today reported full-year results that were broadly in line with forecasts and announced plans to rename itself RELX and simplify its structure in order to â€œincrease share price transparencyâ€�. The company also pledged to repurchase Â£500 million worth of shares in 2015.\nReed Elsevierâ€™s revenue in 2015 came in at Â£5.77 billion, up three percent from 2013 on an underlying basis. Full-year underlying adjusted operating profit rose five percent to Â£1.74 billion. The company forecast further growth this year.\nReed Elsevierâ€™s chief executive officer Erik Engstrom commented:\"In 2014 we maintained good momentum across our key financial metrics of underlying revenue growth, underlying operating profit growth, adjusted earnings per share growth, and return on invested capital. We made further strategic and operational progress as we continued to transform our business, primarily through organic development.\"\nHowever, analysts questioned whether the solid results were enough to support the strong share price momentum, while some of them pointed out that the share buyback planned for this year was down compared to last yearâ€™s Â£600 million. Jefferies analyst David Reynolds said the group had a â€œsomewhat lukewarm finish to the yearâ€�.\nIn todayâ€™s trading, Reed Elsevier shares tumbled 4.6 percent lower to 1,133.00p, making the company the biggest faller in the FTSE 100, as of 12:29 UTC. The stock has advanced 2.9 percent since the start of the year and around 24 percent over the past twelve months.\nThe other main major point in Reed Elsevierâ€™s release was the companyâ€™s plan to simplify its structure into one unit. Under the current structure, Reed Elsevier comprises two separate parent companies, listed in London and Amsterdam. Following the changes, the company, renamed as RELX, will maintain its dual listing, but all assets owned by the two companies will be transferred into a single new group entity. The company will also remove parent company cross-shareholding and balance the share equalisation ratio between the two parent companies at 1:1.\nâ€œWe believe that the set of measures that we are proposing will simplify our structure, help clarify the economic interests of parent company shareholders, and increase share price transparency,â€� the company said.\nAccording to the Financial Times, the 21 analysts offering 12 month price targets for Reed Elsevier have a median target of 1,100p, with a high estimate of 1,300p and a low estimate of 884.00p. As of February 20, 2015, the consensus forecast amongst 27 polled investment analysts covering Reed Elsevier has it that investors should hold their position in the company. This stance has been maintained since 17 March, 2014, when the sentiment of investment analysts deteriorated from â€œoutperformâ€�.\n",
